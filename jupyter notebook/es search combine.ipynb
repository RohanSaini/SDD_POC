Such aggravating circumstances should not be averred in the particulars unless the case warrants severe punishment and it is intended to try the accused by a GCM.(b) It is difficult accurately to define the words 'in the execution of his office', but the military knowledge and experience of the members of a court-martial will enable them in most instances readily to determine whether the superior officer was or was not in the execution of his office. A superior officer in plain clothes may undoubtedly be in the execution of his office; but where the superior officer is in plain clothes, it becomes necessary to prove some knowledge on the part of the accused at the time of the offence that the person who was assaulted or to whom criminal force was used was a superior officer and that he was known to the accused as such, which is not the case where the superior officer is in uniform. On the other hand, there may be circumstances in which a superior officer in uniform is not in the execution of his office. It may be taken in general that using criminal force to or assaulting any superior officer by a person subject to AA over whom it is, at the relevant time, the duty of that superior officer to maintain discipline, would be using criminal force to or assaulting him in the execution of his office. (c) When the accused is charged, with using criminal force to or assaulting his superior officer who is at the time in the execution of his office or if the accused is charged with committing the offence on active service and the court is satisfied that the offence was committed but not on active service or that the superior officer was not then in the execution of his office, he may be found guilty under AA.s.139(7) of the same offence as having been committed in circumstances involving a less severe punishment.\"\n",
