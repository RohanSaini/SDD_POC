In the event of the officer of Defence Accounts Department finding himself unable to agree with the conclusions of the Court, it will be open to him to record a note of  dissent. (RA 519 refers). Persons from the field of Medical, Engineering or Law etc, if necessary, can also be co-opted to assist the C of I but they do not constitute the C of I as such.

The Presiding Officer should be appointed by name and in default, the senior member will preside.  All concerned are to be informed of the sittings of the Court.   A C of I is not a ‘must’ in all cases for initiating disciplinary action.  It should be convened only when a prolonged examination of witnesses, documents of accounts or any local investigation is required which cannot be conveniently done by a CO.  In cases where the facts are straight and clear, and there is no ambiguity as to the circumstances of the case, a C of I is not necessary unless it is obligatory to do so. In such cases, hearing of charge and a S of E may be recorded without first having recourse to investigation by a C of I. Where a C of I has been convened, the decision with regard to taking disciplinary action will normally be taken by the convening authority if competent to take the direct action or by superior authority who is competent to do so<br>\n",

In such cases, hearing of charge and a S of E may be recorded without first having recourse to investigation by a C of I.

Hearsay evidence may be admitted and documents may be included without formal proof, provided the Court is satisfied as to its origin.  It is not advisable to dispense with the attendance of witnesses whose evidence is likely to be disputed.<br>2.   If the court doubts the truthfulness of a witness, it should test his evidence by cross-examination while bearing in mind the evidence already before the Court.  <br>3.  Witness is not allowed to be represented by an advocate, though his legal representative may be allowed to sit silently in the Court while evidence is being recorded.  No right of audience to such advocate/legal representative should be accorded.<br>4.   The Court should  strictly adhere to the terms of reference  and avoid recording unnecessary, irrelevant or superfluous evidence.<br>5.   The Court must record  detailed findings and express opinion, if directed by the convening authority  to do so.<br>6.     The proceedings should be submitted to the convening authority or to such authority as has been stated in the convening order. <br>7.
