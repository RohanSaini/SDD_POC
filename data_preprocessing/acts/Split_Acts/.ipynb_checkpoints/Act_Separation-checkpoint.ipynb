Separately, the Own Credit Adjustment (OCA) and own credit risk included in derivatives (DVA) totalled -175 million euros (compared to -59 million euros in 2016). Excluding these exceptional items, revenues were up by 0.5%.  Revenues were up by 1.5% in the operating divisions despite an unfavourable foreign exchange effect (+2.6% at constant scope and exchange rates): they were stable in Domestic Markets1  (-0.6% at constant scope and exchange rates) due to the low interest rate environment, despite good business development; they were up by 2.7% at International Financial Services (+4.8% at constant scope and exchange rates), driven by the development of the businesses; they rose by 2.1% at CIB (+3.8% at constant scope and exchange rates) thanks to good business growth and despite the lacklustre market environment in the second half of the year.  The Group’s operating expenses, which amounted to 29,944 million euros, were up by 1.9% compared to 2016.

They included in 2016 a 52 million euro compulsory contribution to the resolution process of four Italian banks.  The operating expenses of the operating divisions rose by only 0.5% compared to 2016 thanks to the effects of the cost saving measures: they were down by 0.4% for CIB3 where the transformation plan was launched as early as 2016, declined by 0.1%4 for Domestic Markets1 thanks in particular to the decrease in the retail banking networks and rose by 1.9%5 for ',\n",

The cost of risk was down again (-10.9%) at 2,907 million euros (3,262 million euros in 2016) or  39 basis points of outstanding customer loans.

The Board of Directors will propose at the Shareholders’ Meeting the payment of a dividend of €3.02 per share (+11.9% compared to 2016) to be paid in cash, equivalent to a 50% pay-out ratio which is in line with the plan.  The Group is actively implementing the 2020 transformation plan, an ambitious programme of new customer experiences, digital transformation and operating efficiency.  The good overall performance of the operating divisions this year illustrates the promising start to the plan. The Group thus confirms its 2020 targets and aims at a return on equity above 10% at that time.  The Group continues to strengthen its internal control and compliance systems.

Operating expenses, at 317 million euros, were under control and rose by only 0.5%. Non-operating items totalled 102 million euros (36 million in the fourth quarter 2016) due to the good performance of the associated companies and the booking of a capital gain related to the acquisition of full control of Cargeas in Italy. Pre-tax income was thus up by 19.6% compared to the same period last year, at 425 million euros (+6.5% at constant scope and exchange rates).  Wealth and Asset Management’s revenues (907 million euros) were up by 14.3% compared to the fourth quarter 2016, driven by the very good performance of Wealth Management and Real Estate Services. Operating expenses were up by 7.9%, at 675 million euros as a result of the growth in activity, generating a largely positive jaws effect. After receiving one-third of the net income of private banking in the domestic markets, in Turkey and in the United States, Wealth and Asset Management’s pre-tax income was up sharply (+40.8%) compared to the fourth quarter 2016.   * *     *   CORPORATE AND INSTITUTIONAL BANKING (CIB)  For the whole of 2017, CIB reported solid business growth. The operating division operated though in a challenging market environment in the second half of the year.  CIB actively implemented the 2020 plan. The operating division is developing its base of corporate clients (with good revenue growth in targeted countries, +5.6% in Germany compared to 2016, and a gain of over 125 new client groups this year in Europe) and institutional clients (through the bolstering of the coordinated offering of the businesses), leveraging on the Group’s global presence. It is implementing targeted growth initiatives, signing new partnerships (GTS in the United States to enhance the Global Markets offering to clients and Symphony, a secure communication platform including workflow automation tools for institutional clients which already has over 200,000 users), strengthening the integrated model between the businesses (developing joint Securities Services and Global Markets offerings) and rolling out new offerings. It is accelerating digital transformation with 150 digital projects identified and the development of digital client interfaces like Centric, the online platform for businesses that is already used by close to 8,200 clients.   The operating division reduced its cost income ratio by 1.7 points on the back of the implementation of cost saving programmes launched since 2016 (0.6 billion euros in savings in 2 years) including the development of shared platforms, the implementation of new end-to-end processes and the automation of certain tasks (250 cases of robotics uses identified). It optimised its financial resources by right-sizing sub-profitable portfolios and actively managing its outstandings (allocated equity down by 4.9% compared to 2016), with a gradual reallocation into growth of the resources thereby freed up. CIB thus made significant progress in achieving its 2020 objectives and increased its return on equity by 2.8 points compared to last year, at 16.1%1.  Revenues of the operating division, at 11,704 million euros, were up by 2.1% compared to 2016 despite an unfavourable foreign exchange effect (+3.8% at constant scope and exchange rates).                                                             1 Pre-tax Return on Notional Equity     16 RESULTS AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2017 ',\n",

Securities Services’ revenues, at 1,955 million euros, were up by 7.2% compared to 2016  (+8.3% at constant scope and exchange rates), due to the very good drive of the business and the positive effect of the new mandates. Assets under custody and under management were thus up by 11.0% compared to 31 December 2016 and the number of transactions by 6.4% compared to last year. The business also continued to gain new significant mandates and announced a major strategic partnership in the United States with Janus Henderson Investors (138 billion U.S. dollars of assets under custody)4.  Corporate Banking’s revenues, at 4,165 million euros, were up by 4.3% compared to 2016. They rose by 6.1% at constant scope and exchange rates and were up in the three regions with good growth in Europe, strong rise in Asia Pacific and a good level of business in the Americas region. The business reported solid growth in the transaction businesses: it ranked number 1 for the third year in a row in Trade Finance in Europe and number 3 for the first time in Asia5. At 131 billion euros, loans were up by 1.3% compared to 2016. Deposits continued to grow, at 130 billion euros (+11.1% compared to 2016), as a result of the good development of cash management. The business ranked number 2 for syndicated loans and number 3 for equity linked issues in the EMEA region6. The good growth of the business and the strengthening of its commercial positions were thus illustrated this year by the World Best Bank for Corporates prize awarded by the Euromoney magazine.  At 8,273 million euros, CIB’s operating expenses were down by 0.4% (+1.8% at constant scope and exchange rates) compared to 2016, generating a positive 2 point2 jaws effect. The effect of increased business is largely offset by cost saving measures launched as early as the beginning of 2016.  CIB’s gross operating income was thus up significantly by 8.6%, at 3,431 million euros (+9.2% at constant scope and exchange rates).  CIB’s cost of risk was at a very low level, at 81 million euros, down by 136 million euros compared to 2016. Corporate Banking’s cost of risk was 70 million euros (292 million euros in 2016), or only  6 basis points of outstanding customer loans due to provision write-backs.

Leveraging on the Group’s integrated and diversified model, this plan is based on an ambitious transformation programme in all the operating divisions as well as differentiated business development strategies between Domestic Markets, IFS and CIB in compliance with a strict corporate social and environmental policy.   Good start of the ambitious programme of new customer experiences, digital transformation and savings  The Group is implementing in all the operating divisions an ambitious transformation programme that aims at the same time to implement new customer experiences, speed up digital transformation and improve the operating efficiency.  Five levers are thereby implemented throughout the Group to reinvent the customer experience and build a more effective and digital bank: (1) implement new customer journeys (new digitalised, value-added and personalised customer services and journeys that were illustrated in particular this year by the launch of LyfPay, a universal mobile payment solution, the acquisition of Compte-Nickel and the development of the online platform Centric at CIB); (2) upgrade the operational model by streamlining processes, simplifying organisations and developing shared platforms with, for example, the announcement this year of the roll-out of the BlackRock’s Aladdin platform at Asset Management; (3) adapt information systems by incorporating in particular new technologies in order to speed up the digital transformation and by promoting agile work practices, which entails the development of Data Hubs to interface between banking and digital platforms; (4) make better use of data to serve clients all the whilst bolstering data storage and data analysis capacities: the acquisition this year of Gambit in the robo-advisory field will contribute to this objective;  (5) develop more digital, collaborative and agile work practices, which translated this year in particular in an equity investment in Symphony, a secure and automated communication platform at Global Markets.  The Group plans to invest 3 billion euros between 2017 and 2019 in this programme that will generate 3.4 billion euros in savings during the same period and 2.7 billion euros in annual recurring savings starting from 2020 with a balanced contribution of all the divisions.                                                             1 Excluding valuation reserves (Group share) ',\n",

       " 'In an interest rate environment that is expected to improve only gradually and given new client expectations influenced by digital usages, Domestic Markets reinforces its sales and marketing drive with new customer experiences, enhanced attractiveness of the offering and new services.  As a growth engine for the Group, International Financial Services strengthens its leading positions in its specialised businesses, accelerates their development (new offerings, new partnerships, new regions) and continues the selective expansion of retail banks.  Lastly, CIB optimises the use of its resources and revenue growth by expanding its corporate and institutional client base, targeting particularly certain countries in Europe, and growing fee-generating businesses, all the while reducing its costs.  These differentiated strategies are successfully implemented in all three operating divisions. The sharp rise in their pre-tax income compared to 2016 illustrates the good evolution of their operating performance (Domestic Markets: +4.7%, IFS: +18.2%, CIB: +14.6%).   Commitment for a positive impact on society  The Group is pursuing an ambitious corporate social and environmental responsibility policy and is committed to making a positive impact on society. It thus created this year a Company Engagement Department, whose head is a member of the Group Executive Committee, in order to reinforce its action in this field. This new Department defines the Group’s commitments to civil society, strengthens CSR practices and makes all the company’s levers converge to meet key challenges in society.  The Group aims at financing the economy in an ethical way, promoting the development of its employees, supporting initiatives that have a social impact and playing a major role in the transition toward a low carbon economy. It announced that it will stop funding companies whose principal business activity is gas/oil from shale, oil from tar sands or oil/gas production located in the Arctic region. It also announced that it will stop the financings to tobacco companies. It originated and placed sustainable bonds for an equivalent of 6 billion U.S. dollars (+116% compared to 2016).  This policy committed for a positive impact on society is recognised by very good rankings in major specialised indices (named for example first bank in Europe in terms of CSR by Global Banking & Finance Review).  The Group is moreover a very significant tax payer, with a total amount of taxes and levies of 5.3 billion euros in 2017.      21 RESULTS AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2017  Confirmed 2020 objectives  Based on conservative macroeconomic assumptions, the plan takes into account regulatory constraints expected by 2020.  The Group confirms its 2020 targets with revenue growth above or equal to 2.5% per year and  2.7 billion euros in recurring cost savings starting in 2020, bringing the cost income ratio down to 63%.  It aims at a return on equity above 10% in 2020 with a 12%1 CET1 ratio. The dividend pay-out ratio was increased this year to 50%, in line with the plan.   * *     *   Commenting on these results, Chief Executive Officer Jean-Laurent Bonnafé stated:  “With 7.8 billion euros in net income, BNP Paribas delivered a good performance in 2017, thanks to its integrated and diversified model in service of clients. There was sustained development in the business activities of the operating divisions supported by a stronger economic growth in Europe, costs are under control and the cost of risk is significantly lower.

The underlying purpose of the calculation is to facilitate period-on-period comparisons.   In case of acquired or created entity, the results of the new entity are eliminated from the constant scope results of current-year periods corresponding to the periods when the entity was not owned in the prior-year. In case of divested entities, the entity's results are excluded symmetrically for the prior year for quarters when the entity was not owned. In case of change of consolidation method, the policy is to use the lowest consolidation percentage over the two years (current and prior) for results of quarters adjusted on a like-for-like basis.   Comparative analysis at constant exchange rates are prepared by restating results for the prior-year quarter (reference quarter) at the current quarter exchange rate (analysed quarter).

His liability to punishment under the Act therefore remains unaffected by the place where he commits the offence.  2.  Clause (a)—For the definition of \"Officer\", \\'JCO\", \\'WO\\', and \\'Regular Army\\' see AA.s.3(xviii), (xii), (xxiv) and (xxi) respectively.  3.  Clause (b). —\"Persons enrolled\": see AA.ss.13,14 and 15.  4.  Clause (c).—(The Indian Reserve forces consist of the Regular Reserve and the Supplementary Reserve). Persons belonging to (The Indian Reserve forces are subject to the AA at all times until duly discharged or dismissed. S.5 of the Indian Reserve Forces Act 1888 and rule 3B of Indian Reserve Forces Rules, 1925 refer.  5.

Clause (g). —Personnel mentioned in this clause are subject to the AA only when ordered on duty or service for which they are liable as members of such reserve forces. Officers of the regular Army who retire on pension or gratuity have a liability to serve in the Reserve until they reach the specified age limits.  9. Clause (i). — Persons commonly known as \\'followers\\' are not ordinarily subject to AA unless they have been enrolled under it, but in the interest of discipline and security it is obviously necessary that they and other civilians who accompany any portion of the regular Army should be subject to military discipline on active service and in certain other circumstances. This clause provides for such subjection. All persons, including civilian officers and subordinates, who are subject to AA under this clause are deemed to be of a rank inferior to that of a non-commissioned officer, unless the Central Government have under AA.s.6(1) issued a notification regarding the manner in which such persons shall be so subject: see AA.s.6 and Government of India Notification S.R.O.325 of 1975, (reproduced in part IV) under which civilian government servants are classified as Officers, JCOs. WOs and NCOs according to their total monthly emoluments; the status so conferred is personal and does not give them power of command over others nor does it make them \\'superior officers\\' within the meaning of the AA. Further, subjection of civilians in government service to AA under this clause does not preclude their being dealt with depart mentally under their civil, disciplinary regulations but if they are dealt with under military law, the procedure must be in accordance with the AA and AR.  10.  \"Active service :see AA.s.3(i).

The section empowers the Central Government to dismiss or remove from service any, person subject to the AA but only in accordance with the provisions of the AA or of any rules or regulations made there under; the only legal restrictions are contained in ARs.13-A 14 and 15 which require a show cause notice to be served upon an officer before his service is terminated on grounds of his failure to qualify at an examination or course, misconduct or inefficiency. Such show cause notice may be dispensed with by the Central Govt. when it considers it inexpedient or impracticable to do so or when the officer is already convicted by a criminal court for the misconduct. AR.15-A provides for the release of an officer on medical grounds, which is to be carried out on the recommendations of a Medical Board.  2.  Dismissal under this section, AA.s.18 or 20 is not a punishment as under AA.s.71 but merely amounts to termination of a person's commission service without his consent. Removal is a less grave form of dismissal.  3.  For the date an order of dismissal or removal under this section takes effect, see AR.18 and for the date a sentence of cashiering or dismissal awarded by a court-martial lakes effect, see AR 168.  4.  The competent authority cannot make the dismissal/removal under this section or discharge under AR.13 retrospective nor can such valid dismissal etc.,be cancelled without the person's consent.  5. An officer or JCO holding a substantive rank cannot be reduced to a lower substantive rank though he can be dismissed or removed under this section.  6.

For the date an order of dismissal or removal under this section takes effect, see AR.18, and for the date a sentence of dismissal awarded by a court-martial takes effect, see AR.168.  2.  The difference between dismissal and discharge is that the former! does, while the latter does not, imply culpability. (Further dismissal involves the forfeiture of claim to any pension or gratuity which may have been earned. Discharge does not involve such forfeiture. See Regs Pension Part II Regs 14 and 195)  3.  All persons sentenced to imprisonment (expect persons sentenced by court-martial whose sentences are suspended) and such persons sentenced to imprisonment, as it is not desired to retain in the service will, if not dismissed by-the sentence of a court-martial, be dismissed under this section or under AA.s.19; see Regs Army paras167 and 423 also. COs will use their discretion in applying for the dismissal and the higher authorities their discretion in ordering it. Such a dismissal should not be applied for, or at any rate should not be put into effect, until the convict's prisoner sentenced by court-martial has been committed to a civil prison (AR 168). In the case of a sentence passed by a civil court, the application should, if the dismissal is desired, be made as soon as possible after the sentence has been passed by the civil court. In special cases, a prisoner whom it is not desired to retain in the service may be discharged instead of being dismissed.  4. As to furnishing a JCO, WO or OR who is dismissed with a discharge certificate, see AA.s.23 and AR.12 and Regs Array para 169.  5.  A WO or NCO can be reduced in rank under sub-sec (4), but if the ground is some misconduct which is an offence against the Act, he should, as a rule, be brought to trial by a court-martial. 6.  For ranks see Regs Army para.131. Lance and acting rank is a matter to be dealt with by the CO. 7.  When an acting NCO has been punished by court-martial for an offence, and such punishment does not involve reduction or reversion, his CO can revert him to his permanent grade, not as further punishment, but because the proceedings show him to be unfit to hold his appointment. 8.

Similarly a JCO or OR who is refused compassionate leave or a compassionate posting has no right of complaint under this section unless he can produce some evidence of improper motive for the refusal of leave, etc.  3.  Complaints may be made respecting such matter, but can be made by an individual only. The combined complaint of several can never be permissible, but should not, if well founded, be treated as mutinous, where it is plain that the only object of those making the complaint is to procure redress of the matter by which they think themselves wronged. 4.  A person can only complain once under this section in respect of any such matter. 5.  A complaint cannot legitimately be preferred to a superior officer except in the regular course defined by this section. The channels through which complaints must be preferred are specified in Regs Army Para 361, and it is only where the immediate superior refuses or unnecessarily delays to redress or forward the complaint that direct application can be made to higher authority. The officer in question ought to be informed of the application being made to his superior. For definition of 'officer' and ‘superior officer' see AA.s.3(xviii) and (xxiii) respectively. 6. The authority competent to dispose finally of the matter, complained of is the officer who, in pursuance of regulations or the custom of the service, is authorized to dispose of that matter. As a rule, he is the next superior officer to the officer against whom the complaint is made. If however, a person thinks himself wronged by his commanding officer in respect of his complaint not being redressed, it has been held that he may complain to the brigade commander. 7. A false accusation or false statement made in preferring a complaint under this section or AA.s.27 is punishable under AA.s. 56(b); but the mere fact that a complaint appears to be baseless, or even frivolous, does not render the maker liable to punishment. As to the repetition of baseless complaints, or the submission of complaints in disrespectful language, see notes to AA.s.63.  8.

Offences in relation to the enemy and punishable with death—  Any person subject to this Act who commits any of the following offences, that is to say.—  (a)  shamefully abandons or delivers up any garrison, fortress, post, place or guard, committed to his charge, or which it is his duty to defend, or uses any means to compel or induce any commanding officer or other person to commit any of the said acts; or  (b)  intentionally uses any means to compel or induce any person subject to' military, naval or air force law to abstain from acting against the enemy, or to discourage such person from acting against the enemy; or  (c)  in the presence of the enemy, shamefully casts away his arms, ammunition, tools or equipment or misbehaves in such manner as to show cowardice ; or  (d)  treacherously holds correspondence with, or communicates intelligence to, the enemy or any person in arms against the Union; or  (e)  directly or indirectly assists the enemy with money, arms, ammunition, stores or supplies; or  (f)  treacherously or through cowardice sends a flag of truce to the enemy; or  (g)  in time of war during any military operation, intentionally occasions a false alarm in action, camp, garrison or quarters, or spreads report calculated to create alarm or despondency; or  (h)  in time of action leaves his commanding officer or his post, guard, piquet, patrol or party without being regularly, relieved or without leave ; or  (i)  having been made a prisoner of war, voluntarily serves with or aids the enemy; or  (j)  knowingly harbours or protects an enemy not being a prisoner; or  (k)  being a sentry in time of war or alarm, sleeps upon his post or is intoxicated; or  (l)  knowingly does any act calculated to imperil the success of the military, naval or air forces of India or any forces co-operating therewith or any part of such forces;  shall, on conviction by court-martial,be liable to suffer death or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.  \",\n",
       " \"NOTES  1.  Offences under this section should not be dealt with summarily under AA.s.80, 83 or 84; also see Regs Army para 451.  Because the maximum punishment for offences under this section is death,—   (a) a summary of evidence must be taken.         134  THE ARMY ACT, 1950 WITH NOTES  (b)  a plea of guilty cannot be accepted (AR 52(4)). (c)  the trial should not take place before a DCM/ SCM.  2.  'Subject to this Act': see AA.s.2.  3.  Clause (a): 'Shamefully abandons', etc.—  (a.)  This offence can only be committed by the person in charge of the garrison, post, etc., and not by the subordinates under his command. The surrender of a place by an officer charged with its defence can only be justified by superior's orders or the utmost necessity, such as want of provisions or water, the absence of hope of relief, and the certainty or extreme probability that no further efforts could prevent the place with its garrison, their arms and ammunition, falling into the hands of the enemy. (b)  It must be proved that the accused had no necessity to surrender or abandon the post before a conviction can be obtained. Particulars of a charge under this clause must detail some circumstances which make abandonment in a military sense shameful. 'Shameful' means a positive and disgraceful dereliction of duty and not merely negligence or misapprehension or error of judgment. (c)  ‘Post’ includes any point or position (whether fortified or not) which a detachment may be ordered to hold; and the abandonment of a post would also include the abandonment of a siege if there were no circumstances to warrant such a measure. It has not the same meaning as in clauses (h) and (k) or AA.s.36(c) or (d), where it has reference to the position of an individual.  4.  Clause (b): 'Intentionally'.— As a state of mind (e.g. intention, knowledge) is not capable of positive proof, the court may infer intention from the circumstances proved in evidence. As a general rule, a person is presumed in law to have intended the natural and probable consequences of his act. A court may also presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of events and human conduct. See IEA.s.114.  5.  Enemy—See AA.s.3(x).  6.  Clause (c): 'Shamefully'.— (a)  The particulars of the charge must show the circumstances which make the act in a military sense shameful; see note 3(b) above. (b) The presence of the enemy must be near at hand and a soldier not in the forward area could not be convicted of an offence if, for example, he casts away his arms during an air raid. (c)  Enemy: see AA.s.3(x). The term includes any person in arms against whom it is the duty of a person subject to military law to act. A person subject to the AA, therefore, who, when a comrade 'runs amok', shows cowardice by refraining from acting against him is liable to trial under this clause. See also Regs Army para 348.  7.  'Misbehaves'.— (a)  This means that the accused, from an unsolder-like regard for his personal safety, in the presence of the enemy, failed in respect of some distinct and feasible duty imposed upon him by a specified order or regulation, or by the well-understood custom of the service, or by the requirements of the case, as applicable to the position in which he was placed at the time. Misbehaviour of any kind not evidencing cowardice cannot be charged under the last sentence of this clause. (b)  Where there is evidence that an accused has committed some other offence which is specifically mentioned in the Act as under clause (a) or (b) or AA.s.38(1) such an offence should be charged in preference to a charge under this clause.  8. Clause (d): 'Treacherously'.— (a)  see note 9(a) and (b) below.  (b)  If there is no evidence of treachery, the charge should be laid under AA.s.35(b). (c) In a charge under this clause, it must be proved that the intelligence did in fact reach the enemy. 9. Clause (f): 'Treacherously' or 'through cowardice'. —(a)  Treacherously implies an intention to assist the enemy and must be carefully distinguished from 'through cowardice'  \",\n",
       " '135',\n",
       " \"THE ARMY ACT, 1950 WITH NOTES  which occur in this clause. The Intention to help the enemy is an essential ingredient of the offence of treachery and must be proved before a conviction can be sustained. (b)  The particulars of the charge must show the circumstances which indicate the treachery or cowardice, if there is no treachery or cowardice, the charge should be laid under AA.s.35(c). (c)  Enemy: see AA.s.3(x).  10.  Clause (g): Intentionally.—see note 4 above.  11. 'Occasions a false alarm'.— The particulars of the charge must set out briefly the means whereby the alarm was caused.  12.  'Spreads reports',— The particulars of the charge must detail the reports alleged to have been spread, and should indicate how they were calculated to create alarm or despondency. It is not necessary to aver or prove that the reports were false, indeed the truth may increase the offence ; nor is it necessary to show that any effect was actually produced by the reports spread ; it would, however, seldom be expedient to try an officer or soldier under this section for reports which could not be shown to have had some effect. The offence may be committed either with reference to the troops with whom the offender is serving, or with reference to the inhabitants of the country. When the false alarm is occasioned or such reports are spread otherwise than in time of war or during any military operation, the charge should be framed under AA.s.36(e) which makes punishable such spreading of reports etc., even though through neglect.  13.  Camp.— Includes a bivouac and any quarters, shelter or other place where troops are temporarily located.  14.  Clause (h):  Commanding Officer.—see AA.s.3(v).  15.  'Post'.— (a)  When used with respect to an individual as in this clause and clause (k), means the position or place in which it may be the duty of a person subject to the AA to be, especially when under arms. In determining what, in any particular case is a post, the court will use their military knowledge (AA.s.134). The place in which the person was posted is material and should be stated in the charge. (b)  When a person is charged with leaving his post, it is always necessary to prove that he had been regularly posted. (c)  This offence can be committed by any member of the guard, picquet etc., even the guard etc., commander but a joint charge cannot be preferred.  16.  Without being regularly relieved or without leave.-— These words are in the nature of an exception, and the principle laid down in section 105 of IEA applies. Therefore, though the charge must aver the absence of regular relief or leave, this need not be proved, and the fact of the accused person having quitted his guard, etc., being established it will be for him to show that he was regularly relieved or had leave to quit his guard; nevertheless, any evidence bearing on this point which is known to the prosecutor should be adduced.  17.  Clause (i): 'Voluntarily'—  The term as defined in s.39 of the IPC relates to the causation of effects and not to the doing of acts from which those effects result. However, here it has been used more in its ordinary meaning e.g. of his own free will rather than in its technical sense i.e. it means merely that the accused was willing to do the act charged; it is not necessary to show that he volunteered to do it, or even that he wished to do it. In the absence of any evidence that compulsion was applied the court may find that the accused acted voluntarily; but if from the whole of the evidence given the court think that the accused's will may have been overborne by fear they should acquit him. The test is whether the particular accused was in fact so frightened as to have lost control of his will, not whether the methods used by his captors were such as would cause a reasonably brave man to lose control. Coercion will, therefore, be a defence to such a charge.  18.  Clause (j) : 'Knowingly'.— Evidence should, if possible, be given that the accused knew the person harboured or protected to be an enemy who is not a prisoner but if the  \",\n",

       " \"THE ARMY ACT, 1950 WITH NOTES  fact of the harbouring or protecting is proved, the court may infer knowledge from the circumstances.  19.  'Harbouring'.— The word 'harbour' includes the supplying a person with shelter, food, drink, money, clothes, arms, ammunition or means of conveyance or the assisting of a person by any means, whether of the above kinds or not to evade apprehension : IPC section 52A.  20.  Enemy.— See AA.s.3(x).  21.  Clause (k): 'Post'.— (a)  As used with respect to an individual in this and other clauses the term refers to the position or place in which it may be the duty of a person subject to this Act to be, especially when under arms. With respect, in particular, to a sentry, it applies (i) to the spot where the sentry is left to the observance of his duties by the officer, JCO or NCO posting him, or (ii) to any limits specially pointed out as his beat. The fact that a sentry has not been regularly posted is immaterial if he is charged with an offence committed while on his post provided evidence is given to prove that he adopted the duty of sentry. (b) In determining what, in any particular case, is a post the court will use their military knowledge : AA.s.134. (c)  A sentry found sleeping even a short distance from his 'post' should be charged with leaving his post under clause (h) or AA.s.36(d); he cannot be charged with sleeping on his post under this clause. However, where a sentry is found intoxicated, he could be charged under this clause though he is so found at a short distance away from his post as the place where he is found intoxicated is immaterial not being ingredient of the offence. (d)  A policeman on gate duty is not a sentry. (e)  Two or more accused cannot be tried jointly with committing an offence under this clause.  (f)  The same offence when committed by a sentry in circumstances which do not fall under this clause is triable under clause (c) of AA.s.36.  22.  Clause (l): 'Knowingly'.— See notes 4 and 18 above.  A charge under this clause should particularise the actual acts alleged. The act or acts must be shown to have been deliberately done by the accused with the intention of imperiling the success of the said forces. Such intention may be proved in evidence or may be inferred from the circumstances.  35. Offences in relation to the enemy and not punishable with death.— Any person subject to this Act who commits any of the following offences, that is to say,—  (a)  is taken prisoner, by want of due precaution, or through disobedience of orders, or wilful neglect of duty, or having been taken prisoner, fails to rejoin his service when able to do so; or  (b)  without due authority holds correspondence with or communicates intelligence to the enemy or having come by the knowledge, of any such correspondence or communication, wilfully omits to discover it immediately to his commanding or other superior officer; or  (c)  without due authority sends a flag of truce to the enemy; shall, on conviction by court-martial be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to fourteen years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.  NOTES 1. Offences under this section should not be dealt with summarily under AA.ss.80, 83 or 84. 2.

Such a court of inquiry held in the absence of the said person is provisional and as such has no effect except on the pay and allowances of that person.  3.  Clause (b):  This offence is less grave in form than the one under AA.s.34(d).  4.  (a)  'Communicates intelligence to'.— A man must be taken to intend the natural consequences of his acts, and this clause appears to be wide enough to cover the case of intelligence reaching the enemy through the capture or the re-publication (e.g., by relatives or newspapers) of letters, sketches, photographs, etc. Everyone connected with the forces should recognise the grave danger of assisting the enemy by gossip, whether verbal or written, as to plans, prospects, operations, numbers, etc. As to unauthorised publication of official documents see Regs Army para 318 and Official Secrets Act, 1923 (reproduced in part III). (b) In a charge under this clause however, it must be proved that the intelligence did in fact reach the enemy.  5.  Clause (c): The offence under this clause is less grave in form than the one under AA.s.34(f).  36.  Offences punishable more severely on active service than at other times.— Any person subject to this Act who commits any of the following offences, that is to say,— (a) forces a safeguard, or forces or uses criminal force to a sentry; or (b)  breaks into any house or other place in search of plunder; or (c)  being a sentry sleeps upon his post, or is intoxicated; or (d)  without orders from his superior officer leaves his guard, piquet patrol or post; or (e)  intentionally or through neglect occasions a false alarm in camp, garrison, or quarters or spreads reports calculated to create unnecessary alarm or despondency; or  (f)  makes known the parole, watch ward  or countersign to any person not entitled to receive it; or knowingly gives a parole, watchward or counter sign different from what he received; shall, on conviction by court-martial, if he commits any such offence when on active service, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to fourteen years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned; and  if he commits any such offence when not on active service, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.  \",\n",

Clause (a): safeguard\\'s—A safeguard is a party of soldiers detached for the protection of some person or persons, or of a particular village, house, or other property. A single sentry posted from such party is still part of the safeguard, and it is as criminal to force him by breaking into the house or other property under his special care as to force the whole party. A man posted solely to control traffic is not a \"safeguard\" for the purposes of this provision.   3.  \\'Forces\\',— Does not necessarily mean use of physical force.

'Sentry'.- (a) A sentry is posted for protecting some place, property or person and any forcible interference with such protection amounts to an offence under this clause provided the accused was aware that the sentry was in fact acting as such. (b)  An accused charged under this clause for using criminal force to a sentry can be found guilty of attempting to use such criminal force under AA.s.139(8) or of assaulting the sentry under AA.s.139(3). Similarly, if the charge is laid under AA.s.69 for using criminal force to a sentry, the accused can be convicted of attempting to use such criminal force to or assaulting him under A A.s.139(6). (c)  See also note 21 to AA.s.34, as to duties of sentries, (d)  A policeman on gate duty is not a sentry.  6.  Clause (b): (a) The 'other place' should be specified in the charge. (b)  This clause, having regard to special military significance of the term plunder, is applicable only to offences committed on active service. (c)  For definition of 'house-breaking' see IPC.s.445. A house indicates some structure intended for affording some sort of protection to the person dwelling inside it or for the property placed there for custody. What is a house must always be a question of degree and circumstances.  7.  Clause (c): 'Sentry'.—For definition see note 21 to AA.s.34 and note 5 above. A sentry found asleep even a short distance from his post should be charged with leaving his post under clause (d), he cannot properly be charged with being asleep on his post, though he may be charged under AA.s.63 with being asleep when on sentry duty. However the words 'upon his post' do not qualify the words 'is intoxicated. It is therefore enough to constitute the offence if a person subject to the AA acting as a sentry is found intoxicated on his post or elsewhere during his tenure of duty as a sentry.  8.  Clause (d): Superior officer.—For definition see AA.s.3(xxiii).  9.  'Post'.—(a) See notes 15 and 21 to AA.s.34. When a person is charged with leaving his post it is always necessary to prove that he had been regularly posted or had under taken the duty on that post although he has not been regularly posted. Where a member of a guard or piquet furnishing a sentry for a post receives orders that he will relieve the sentry on the post at a fixed hour, and in due course does so, he will have been regularly posted although the officer, JCO or NCO in charge was not present himself at that time. (b)  This offence can be committed by any member of the guard, piquet Or patrol, even the guard, etc., commander but a joint charge cannot be preferred.  10.  Clause (e): See notes to AA.s.34(g),  11.  'Through neglect: See note3(b)to AA.s.63.  12.  (f):  (a)  The particulars of the charge must aver that the accused made known the watchward etc., to a person and that person was not entitled to receive the watchward etc. (b)  'Knowingly'.—see note 18 to AA.s.34 above.  37.  Mutiny.—-Any person subject to this Act who commits any of the following offences, that is to say,— (a)  begins, incites, causes, or conspires with any other persons to cause any mutiny in the military, naval or air forces of India or any forces co-operating therewith; or (b)  joins in any such mutiny; or (c)  being present at any such mutiny, does not use his utmost endeavours to suppress the same; or   \",\n",

       " 'THE ARMY ACT, 1950 WITH NOTES   (b)  Words in the plural include the singular (s. 13 General Clauses Act, 1897). Therefore a person can be charged under clause (a) with conspiracy with one other person to cause a mutiny. (c)  A person cannot be charged generally with mutiny, or with an act of mutiny, but only with some one or more of the specified offences laid down in this section. If (d)  knowing or having reason to believe in the existence of any such mutiny, or of any intention to mutiny or of any such conspiracy, does not, without delay, give information thereof to his commanding or other superior officer; or (e)  endeavours to seduce any person in the military, naval or air forces of India from his duty or allegiance to the Union; shall, on conviction by court-martial, be liable to suffer death or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.  NOTES 1.  Offences under this section should not be dealt with summarily under AA.s.80, 83 or 84. 2. ( a)  The limitation of time for the commencement of trial (three years) prescribed by AA.s.122 does not apply to the offence of mutiny.  (b)  As the maximum punishment for offences under this section is death ;—  (i)  a summary of evidence must be taken. (ii)  a plea of guilty cannot be accepted [AR 52(4)].  (iii)  the trial should not take place before a summary or district court-martial.  3.  (a)  Mutiny implies collective insubordination, or a combination of two or more persons to resist, or to induce others to resist, lawful military authority. (b) Words in the plural include the singular (s. 13 General Clauses Act, 1897). Therefore a person can be charged under clause (a) with conspiracy with one other person to cause a mutiny. (c) A person cannot be charged generally with mutiny, or with an act of mutiny, but only with some one or more of the specified offences laid down in this section. If he has not brought himself within the terms of the section, his offence, however much it may tend towards mutiny, must be dealt with as insubordination and the provisions of AA.s.40 or 41 will usually afford ample powers for the purpose. Thus, where there is an actual mutiny or a conspiracy to mutiny, all concerned in the mutiny or conspiracy can be tried under this section for causing or conspiring to cause, or joining in, the mutiny, as the case may be. If no mutiny or conspiracy exists, a person can only be tried under this section if the charge is one of being present at a mutiny not using his utmost endeavours to suppress the same or of failing to inform his commanding or other superior officer of an intent to cause mutiny or such conspiracy or of endeavouring to seduce any person in the forces from his duty or allegiance to the Union. (d)  In framing a charge under this section the specific act or acts which are alleged to have constituted the offence must always be averred; and the offence is so grave that a charge for it should only be brought on very clear evidence. Cases of insubordination, even on the part of two or more persons, should unless there appears to be a combined design on their part to resist authority, be charged jointly under AA. s. 40(a) with using criminal force, assaulting, or separately under AA.s.40(b)or(c) with using threatening or insubordinate language, or under AA.s.41, or, if these sections are inapplicable jointly or separately under AA.s.63. Provocation by a superior or the existence of grievances, is no justification for mutiny or insubordination though such circumstances would be given due weight in considering the question of punishment. (e)  Collective petitions/representations or the submission of a petition through the medium of any association in respect of military matters are forbidden on this ground.  4.  If there is evidence that a person caused, or conspired with others to cause a mutiny, but a doubt exists as to whether he took such an active part as to have actually joined, in the mutiny, he may be charged under clause (b) with an alternative charge under clause (a). On the other hand, doubts may arise whether the persons who appear to be taking an active part are actually acting in combination, and in such cases it is desirable to prefer separate charges in the alternative under AA.s.40 or AA.s.41 .as appropriate.

Persons present on, parade or present accidentally or induced by false pretences to attend a meeting where a mutiny is being contrived may still be guilty of an offence under clause (c) although they took no active part in the proceedings.  6.  (a)  Not using his utmost endeavour in clause (c) does not necessarily mean the utmost of which a person is capable, but such endeavours as person might reasonably and fairly be expected to make, and every person in a squad not marching or not coming from their barrack room when duly ordered, is guilty of mutiny.  (b)  In clause (d), it will be noticed that the person who comes to know of an existing or intended mutiny will have performed his duty under this clause if he gives information without delay either to his CO or any other superior officer. Such information would naturally be given to the immediate superior of the person, who would, in his turn, be bound to transmit it to higher authority.  (c)  Commanding officer: see AA.s.3(v).

(3)  Any person subject to this Act who, being cognizant of any desertion or attempt at desertion of a person subject to this Act, does not forthwith give notice to his own or some other superior officer, or take any steps in his power to cause such person to be apprehended, shall, on conviction by court-martial, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.

       " '1.  General.—(a)  An offence under sub-section (1) of this section when on active service or under orders for active service should not be dealt with summarily under AA.ss.80, 83 or 84. (b)  When a superior officer directs the case of an offender against whom a charge for desertion has been preferred to be summarily disposed of, he should order the offence to be disposed of as one of absence without leave. See notes to AA.s.39. See generally AA.ss.104 and 105 and Regs Army paras 376 to 381. (c)  Under AA.s.120(3), a CO can try by SCM a NCO or sepoy under his command, for an offence under this section. As a rule a NCO or OR cannot be attached to another unit for purposes of his trial by SCM; but see Regs Army para 381 for the circumstances when a CO other than the CO of the unit to which a NCO or OR properly belongs, can try him by SCM for an offence of desertion or absence without leave.  2  Sub sec.(1).—Desertion is distinguished from absence without leave under AA.s.39; in that desertion or attempt to desert the service implies an intention on the part of      ',\n",
       " '141 THE ARMY ACT, 1950 WITH NOTES  the accused either (a) never to return to the service or (b) to avoid some important military duty (commonly known as constructive desertion) e.g., service in a forward area, embarkation for foreign service or service in aid of the civil power and not merely some routine duty or duty only applicable to the accused like a fire piquet duty. A charge under this section cannot lie unless it appears from the evidence that one or other such intention existed; further, it is sufficient if the intention in (a) above was formed at the time during the period of absence and not necessarily at the time when the accused first absented himself from unit/duty station. 3.  A person may be a deserter although he re-enrolls himself, or although in the first instance his absence was legal (e.g. authorised by leave), the criterion being the same, viz., whether the intention required for desertion can properly be inferred from the evidence available (the surrounding facts and the circumstances of the case). 4.  Intention to desert may be inferred from a long absence, wearing of disguise, distance from the duty station and the manner of termination of absence e.g., apprehension but such facts though relevant are only prima facie, and not conclusive, evidence of such intention. Similarly the fact that an accused has been declared an absentee under AA.s.106 is not by itself a deciding factor if other evidence suggests the contrary. 5.  A person subject to the AA charged with desertion may be found guilty of an attempt to desert or of absence without leave, and such a person charged with attempting to desert may be found guilty of being absent without leave provided evidence was avail- able to prove the absence; see AA.s.139(1)and (2). When the absence began more than 3 years before the date of trial, the provisions of AA.s.122 must be borne in mind and complied with. For instance where an accused person is charged with desertion commencing on a date more than three years before the date of trial, he cannot be found guilty under AA. s. 139(1) of absence without leave from that date but such absence must be restricted to a period not exceeding three years immediately prior to the commencement of trial; where such a finding and sentence has been wrongly confirmed, the competent authority under AA.s.163 may substitute a valid finding and pass a sentence for the offence specified or involved in such finding. 6.  When a person subject to AA has been absent from his duty without authority for a period of thirty days, a court of inquiry is mandatory under AA.s.106 but even after such a court of inquiry has been held, the case can still be disposed of summarily under AA.s.80, 83 or 84 but the charge should be laid for absence without leave under AA.s.39. As to inquiring into absence see AR183 also. 7.  AA.s.122 which prescribes the limitation of time for the trial of offences expressly excludes desertion; but where a person other than an officer has subsequently to the commission of the offence served continuously in an exemplary manner for not less than three years, he cannot be tried for such offence of desertion which was committed before the commencement of such three years other than desertion on active service. For \\'exemplary service\\' see Regs Army para 465. 8. Two or more persons cannot be tried jointly with committing the offence of desertion under this sub sec. 9.  AA.ss.90(a) and 91(a) read with P and A Regs provide for automatic forfeiture of pay and allowances for every day a person subject to AA is absent on desertion or without leave. 10.  As to forfeiture of service for pension or gratuity, which follows upon desertion, and restoration of service so forfeited, see Regs pension (Part I) Reg 123. The period between desertion and apprehension/surrender does not, under the prescribed conditions of enrolment; reckon as service towards discharge. Service rendered previous to desertion, though forfeited for purposes of pension or gratuity, reckons as service towards discharge.  As to a person who absents himself from his corps or department and enrolls again, see AA.s.43 and notes thereto. 11. (a) While framing charges of desertion or absence without leave care must be taken to ensure that the particulars allege and the prosecution prove, both the date when the absence began, and the date when it ended (by return, surrender, apprehension or re-enrolment). It is not sufficient to allege and prove absence \"on or about\" a certain date, or \"from some date subsequent to……………”. (b) Commencement of absence under this section or AA.s.39 may be proved in the following ways : (i) orally by a witness who found the accused absent, or   ',\n",

       " 'THE ARMY ACT, 1950 WITH NOTES  (ii) by production by a witness on oath, who can identify the accused as the person named in   (aa) the declaration of a court of inquiry held under AAs.106 as entered in the court-martial book; or  (bb) a certified true copy of the above declaration on IAFD-918; or ',\n",
       " \"Provided AA.s 106 and AR 183 have been compiled with (cc)  an entry in a part II Order; provided the entry is one that is made in Regimental orders/books in pursuance of military duty and the orders purported to be signed by the CO or by the officer whose duty it is to make such record AA.s.142(3). Such an entry should only be used as evidence where no direct evidence and no declaration of a court of inquiry is available and even then it is only prima facie evidence and may be rebutted; or (dd)  a copy of such an order purporting to be certified to be a true copy by the officer having custody of such order; see AA.s.142(4). (c)  Termination of absence may be proved in the following ways : — (i)  by oral evidence of a witness who apprehended the accused or to whom the accused surrendered; or (ii)  by production by a witness on oath, who can identify the accused as the person named in : (aa)  a certificate on IAFD-910 stating the fact, date and place of surrender or apprehension and the manner in which the accused was dressed and signed by a police officer not below the rank of an officer in charge of a police station to whom the accused surrendered or by whom he was apprehended AA.s.142(6); or (bb)  where the surrender was made to an officer or other person subject to AA or any portion of the regular Army or where the accused was apprehended by an officer or other person subject to AA, a similar certificate signed by the 'proper' officer : AA.s.142(5) (Also see Regs Army para 378); or (cc)  a Part II Order showing the taking on strength properly signed in accordance with AA.s.142(3); or (dd)  a certified true copy of such order in accordance with AA.s.142(4); or (ee)  where the absence terminated by fraudulent enrolment in the regular Army, the enrolment paper or certified true copy thereof. AA.s.141(2).  12.  The commencement of an absence cannot be proved by production of an absence report as this is not a regimental book under Regs Army para 610.  13  Attempt to desert.— To establish an attempt to desert, some act which, if completed, would constitute desertion must be proved, e.g., a soldier is arrested in the act of leaving his unit lines without authority, dressed in plain clothes and carrying his personal kit, when the circumstances indicate that he intends to desert. The test is whether the act, or series of acts, in the course of which the offender is apprehended or surrenders, would, if completed, amount to desertion. A mere preparation to desert, if unaccompanied by any such act which if completed would amount to. Desertion does not constitute an offence of attempting to desert. But if there is evidence that the offender actually absented himself from the place where his duty required him to be and that he intended to desert, the offence is complete and a charge for desertion, not for an attempt to desert should be framed. Attempt to desert is itself made a substantive offence, and a charge for the same should be preferred under this sub sec and not under AA.s.65.  14.  For definition of active service; see AA.s.3(i).  15.  Abetment of desertion of a person subject to the AA can be charged under AA.s.66.  16.  Sub sec (2) : Knowingly.—see note 18 to AA.s34.  17.

Sub sec.(3).— To substantiate a charge the particulars must specify the precise steps which, it is alleged by the prosecution, were within the power of the accused to take to cause the deserter or intending deserter to be apprehended. The times at which the accused became aware of the desertion or attempt to desert and gave notice to a superior officer, are material and should be disclosed in the charge.  20.  Superior officer means the 'Superior Officer' in relation to the offender, not to the deserter or intending deserter,  \",\n",
       " '39.  Absence without leave.— Any person subject to this Act who commits any of the following offences, that is to say,— (a)  absents himself without leave; or (b)  without sufficient cause overstays leave granted to him; or (c)  being on leave of absence and having received information from proper authority that any corps, or portion of a corps, or any department, to which he belongs, has been ordered on active service, fails, without sufficient cause, to rejoin without delay; or (d)  without sufficient cause fails to appear at the time fixed at the parade or place appointed for exercise or duty; or (e)  when on parade, or on the line of march, without sufficient cause or without leave from his superior officer, quits the parade or line of march; or (f)  when in camp or garrison or elsewhere, is found beyond any limits fixed, or in any place, prohibited by any general/ local or other order, with out a pass or written leave from his superior officer; or (g)  without leave from his superior officer or without due cause, absents himself from any school when duly ordered to attend there;  shall,on conviction by court-martial, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.  NOTES  1.  Two or more accused should not be jointly charged with an offence under this section.  2.  Clause (a): The criterion between desertion and absence without leave is intention. Where all the ingredients of the offence of desertion are present except an intention not to return to the service or to avoid some important military duty, the offence will be one of absence without leave or any other offence of this genus e.g., failure to appear at the time fixed at the parade.  3.  (a)  Absence without leave must not be involuntary absence e.g., due to illness or being taken into civil or military custody, whether on surrender or apprehension. However, the mere reporting by an absentee to a provost officer or M.C.O. or the fact that such provost officer or M.C.O. orders the absentee to return to his unit will not terminate the voluntary absence; which will continue to run until the absentee rejoins his unit.  (b)  To render an absence involuntary there must be some physical impracticability, outside the control of the offender, that prevents his return to his unit. Inability to return to his unit through intoxication which is an offence under AA.s.48 will not make such absence involuntary nor would an inability which arises through lack of money or loss of his railway or other ticket. Further, where the absence without leave was originally voluntary and has by change of circumstances, subsequently become involuntary the offender may be convicted of absence for the whole period. Similarly, an absence that was originally involuntary becomes voluntary, if the offender fails to return to his unit at the earliest practicable moment e.g., failure to return on release from a civil prison.  (c)  Where the prosecution proves that the accused was absent and that he had not been granted leave, the court may, in the absence of any satisfactory explanation by the accused, infer that the absence was voluntary.

       " '4.  (a)  A court considering a charge under this section should consider \\'\\'was the accused at the place where his duty required him to be?\" (b)  An offence under this section is one of absence without leave, and not merely absence. Leave of absence must be notified to the applicant for such leave. A person who has applied for leave, and departs from his unit before it is actually granted, commits the offence of being absent without leave, even though the leave had been granted but not notified to him. (c)  When evidence has been given of the accused\\'s absence, or failure to appear at the place required, and that evidence is sufficient to raise an inference that he had no leave of absence, then the court may look to the accused to provide evidence, by way of defence, for his \"leave\", \"sufficient cause\" or \"due cause\" as the case may be.  5. (a)  For proof of commencement and termination of absence see note 11to AA.s.38.  (b)  The particulars of a charge of absence without leave should state the date when the absence began and terminated. Where the exact hour of the absence is material for the purpose of proving a whole day\\'s absence, as it may be under the provisions of AA.s.92, the hour of the offender\\'s departure and return should also be stated in the particulars of the charge. (c)  Where, for some reason, it is not possible to prove the exact dates of commencement and termination of the absence, but it is possible to show that an absentee was at some place other than his place of duty ,at charge under AA.s.63 alleging that he was improperly at one place; whereas his duty required him to be elsewhere may be preferred.  6.  Under AA.s.90(a), read with P & A Regs (Officers), an officer automatically forfeits all pay and allowances due to him for every day he absents himself without leave or overstays the period of his leave unless a satisfactory explanation has been given to his CO and has been approved by the Central Govt. AA.s.91(a),read with P & A Regs (OR), makes such deductions also automatic in the case of persons subject to AA other than officers; the CO of such absentee can, however, remit such penal deduction if the absence does not exceed five days; AR.195(b). The penal deductions under AAss.90(a) and 91(a) may be made without the absentee being convicted by court-martial or dealt with summarily under AA.ss.80, 83 or 84.  7. Under AA.s.139(1) and (2), a person subject to AA and charged with desertion or attempted desertion may be found guilty of absence without leave but not vice versa. Also see note 5 toAA.s.38.  8.  When a person has been absent without leave for 30 clear days or has overstayed his leave without sufficient cause for that period, a court of inquiry will be assembled under AA,s.106. Also see AR 183.  9.  Under AA.s.120(3), a CO can try by SCM a NCO or a sepoy under his command for an offence under this clause. For the circumstances when a CO other than a CO of the unit to which a NCO or OR properly belongs, can try an offence under this clause see note (c) to AA.s.38.  10.  If at any trial for desertion or absence without leave, overstaying leave or not rejoining when warned for service, the accused states in his defence any sufficient or reasonable cause for his absence and refers in support to any officer in the service of the Govt. it is the duty of the court to address such officer if it appears that such officer may prove or disprove the accused\\'s statement;  AA.s.143. Failure to comply with this provision may result in annulment of the proceedings.  11.  Clause (b).—This offence is basically the same as in clause (a); except that the absence becomes illegal only after the expiry of his authorised leave; whereas under clause (a)  the absence is illegal ab-initio.  12. If it is proved that a person subject to the AA. has overstayed his leave, it will be for him to show that he had sufficient cause (e.g., sickness or the unexpected interruption of the ordinary means of transit) for doing so. If, however, any evidence as to the cause of his failure to return is known to the prosecutor, it should be adduced, leaving it to the court to decide as to the sufficiency of such cause.    ',\n",
       " '145 THE ARMY ACT, 1950 WITH NOTES 145  13.  Clause (c)— Charges under clauses (c), (d), (e) or (g) should not ordinarily be preferred as any offence under those clauses must almost invariably amount to an offence under clause (a) and a charge under the latter clause is simple to prove.  14.  Without sufficient cause: see note13 above.  15.  Corps—sees AR 187(3). Department.—see AA.S.3(ix). Active service.—see AA.s.3(i).  16.  Clause (d).—(a) before a conviction can be obtained under this clause, it must be proved that the time was fixed and the place appointed by competent authority, and that the accused was aware of this fact. These facts are sometimes difficult to prove and therefore a charge of absence without leave under clause (a) is usually more practicable. See also note13 above.  (b)  A person who is late for parade commits an offence under this clause, equally with one who is altogether absent.  (c)  Absence from a parade etc., through intoxication should not be charged under this section but underAA.s.48 for intoxication. Ignorance of the order for the parade, although exposing the offender to a charge under AA.s.63, for failing to acquaint himself with the order as required by Regs Army para 324, will not render him liable to a conviction under this clause. Where a reasonable misapprehension of the order exists, based on lack of clarity in the terms of the order itself, this may, in certain circumstances amount to a good defence to the charge.  17.  Clause (f).—\\'Camp\\' includes a bivouac and any quarters, shelter, or other place where troops are temporarily lodged.  18.  \\'General, local or other order\\'s—The orders specified in this clause are standing orders or orders in writing and applicable continuously over a period of time to persons present in a certain geographical area or in a certain military formation. Ignorance of the order is no excuse if the order is one which the accused ought, in the ordinary course, to know. But a misapprehension reasonably arising from want of clarify in the order is a ground for exculpation. The existence of the order must be proved by producing it or a certified copy where so permissible under AA.s.142(4) on oath/affirmation to the court. A written order cannot be proved by oral testimony. Evidence must also be led to show that the order was duly posted or brought to the notice of the accused, or that he was otherwise in a position to be acquainted with its contents.  19.  (a) A charge alleging \"without a pass or written leave from his superior officer would be a good charge under this clause, since it is a single offence for him to have neither a pass nor written leave. On the other hand, a charge alleging \"beyond the limits fixed by general or local orders\" would be bad since it might be one offence to be beyond the limits fixed by general orders, and another offence to be beyond the limits fixed by local orders (see AR 30). (b) Without a pass or written leave from his superior officer.—These words are in the nature of an exception, and on being proved that the accused was found beyond fixed limits, it will rest on him to show that he had the proper authority.  20.  Superior officer. See AA.s.3(xxiii).  40.  Striking or threatening superior officers. — Any person subject to this Act who commits any of the following offences, that is to say, — (a)  uses criminal force to or assaults his superior officer; or (b)  uses threatening language to such officer; or (c)  uses insubordinate language to such officer; shall on conviction by court-martial, if such officer is at the time in the execution of his office or, If the offence is committed on active service, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to fourteen years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned; and in other cases, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.   Provided that in the case of an offence specified in clause (e), the imprisonment shall not exceed five years.  ',\n",

       " 'THE ARMY ACT,1950 WITH NOTES NOTES 1.  Clause (a).— Offences under this clause should not be dealt with summarily under AA.s.80, 83 or 84. 2.  (a) For definition of \\'force\\', using criminal force and \\'assault\\', see IPC.ss.349, 350 and 351 (PartIII).The difference between the offence mentioned in this clause will be clear from the following examples : —  (i)  A throws a stone at B. If the stone hits B, A has used criminal force, if it misses him, A has attempted to use criminal force. (ii)  A, during an altercation with B, picks up a stone in a threatening manner. If A intends, or knows it to be likely, that this will cause B to believe that A is about to throw the stone at him. A commits an assault on B. An \\'assault\\' is something less than the use of criminal force; the force being cut short before the blow actually falls. It seems to consist in an attempt or offer by a person having present ability, with force to do any hurt or violence to the person of another, and it is committed whenever a well founded apprehension of peril from a force partially or fully put in motion is created, e.g., when a person draws a bayonet or otherwise makes a show of violence against a superior but not when net is behind the bars or at such a distance as to rule out at the moment any actual use of criminal force An assault is thus included in every use of criminal force, and is an intermediate stage thereof. (b)  If the force be used in the exercise of the right of private defence, for instance if it be shown that it was necessary, or that at the moment the accused had reason to believe it was necessary for his actual protection from injury, and that he used no more force than was reasonably necessary for this purpose, he is legally justified in using it and commits no offence. See IPC.ss.96, 97—102 (Part III). (c)  Provocation is not a ground of acquittal, but tends to mitigate the punishment; evidence of provocation, if tendered, must therefore be admitted. Also see note 6 to AR 52. (d) As to intoxication as an excuse or defence to a charge under this section, see note4to AAs.48.   3.  A joint charge under this clause can be sustained provided that the use of criminal force or assault was the result of a concerted action in furtherance of a common intent (IPC.s.34) though in some cases such concerted use of force may amount to an offence under AA. s.37(b) also.  4.  When use of criminal force to a superior is accompanied by insubordinate language, the use of criminal force only should be charged (assuming that the evidence is satisfactory) and the language would be admissible in evidence to show the manner in which the offence was committed.  5.  A person charged with using criminal force may be found guilty of an attempt to use criminal force or assault (AA.s.139(8) and (3)).  6.  (a) Superior Officer.—See AA.s.3(xxiii). (b)  While framing a charge under this section, the name of the superior officer shut be set out in the particulars of the charge. (c)  The expression \\'superior officer\\' in this section and in AA.s.41 means not only a superior in rank but also a senior in the same grade where that seniority gives power of command according to the usages of the service, but one sepoy can never be the \"Superior officer\" of another. The court should be satisfied, before conviction, that the accused knew the person, with respect to whom the offence was committed, to be a superior officer .If the superior did not wear the insignia of his rank, and was not personally known to the accused, evidence would be necessary to show that the accused was otherwise aware of his being his superior officer, or had reason to believe him, to be this superior officer. If such evidence is not available, the accused should be charged under AA.s.63 or 69. (d)  Where the accused is charged with an offence against a superior officer who is of the same grade, evidence must be adduced to show that the latter is senior to the accused. (e)  The lower the rank of the superior the less is the gravity of the offence. Also see Regs Army para 450.       ',\n",
       " \"147 THE ARMY ACT, 1950 WITH NOTES  NOTES 7. (a) The offence under this clause or clauses (b) and (c) is punishable more severely if such superior officer was at the relevant time in the execution of his office or if the offence is committed on active service. Such aggravating circumstances should not be averred in the particulars unless the case warrants severe punishment and it is intended to try the accused by a GCM. (b)  It is difficult accurately to define the words 'in the execution of his office', but the military knowledge and experience of the members of a court-martial will enable them in most instances readily to determine whether the superior officer was or was not in the execution of his office. A superior officer in plain clothes may undoubtedly be in the execution of his office; but where the superior officer is in plain clothes, it becomes necessary to prove some knowledge on the part of the accused at the time of the offence that the person who was assaulted or to whom criminal force was used was a superior officer and that he was known to the accused as such, which is not the case where the superior officer is in uniform. On the other hand, there may be circumstances in which a superior officer in uniform is not in the execution of his office. It may be taken in general that using criminal force to or assaulting any superior officer by a person subject to AA over whom it is, at the relevant time, the duty of that superior officer to maintain discipline, would be using criminal force to or assaulting him in the execution of his office.  (c)  When the accused is charged, with using criminal force to or assaulting his superior officer who is at the time in the execution of his office or if the accused is charged with committing the offence on active service and the court is satisfied that the offence was committed but not on active service or that the superior officer was not then in the execution of his office, he may be found guilty under AA.s.139(7) of the same offence as having been committed in circumstances involving a less severe punishment. 8.  Clause (b).—A joint charge of using threatening or insubordinate language to a superior officer should not be preferred. 9.  Where the charge is for using threatening or insubordinate language the particulars of the charge must state the expressions or their substance, and the superior to whom they were addressed. See note 7 above. 10.  Expressions, however offensive to a superior, that are used (a) in the course of a judicial, inquiry, (b) by a party to that inquiry, and (c) upon a matter pertinent to and bonafide for the purposes of that inquiry, as, for instance, the credibility of a witness, are privileged, and cannot be made the subject of a criminal charge. 11 . Expressions used of a superior officer and not within his hearing, or which cannot be proved to be used to a superior officer, must be charged as an offence under AA.s.63, and not under this section, but the use of threatening or otherwise insubordinate language regarding one superior to (in the sense that it is intended to be heard by) another superior constitutes an offence of using threatening or insubordinate language under this section. 12.  Threatening language means language from which a person addressed may reasonably infer that criminal force may be used. This may be inferred either from the character of the words used or from the surrounding circumstances. 13.  Whereas all threatening language is insubordinate the converse is not true; therefore unless there is no doubt as to his intention an accused should be charged with using insubordinate language rather than threatening. A court may, however, if satisfied in other respects that an offence under this section has been committed, make a special finding when an accused is charged with the offence of using threatening language that he was guilty of using insubordinate language. (AA.s.139(4)). 14.  Clause (c).—See notes 7 to 11 and 13 above. 15.  The words must be used with an insubordinate intent, that is to say, they must be, either in themselves, or in the manner or circumstances in which they are spoken, insulting or disrespectful, and in all cases it must reasonably appear that they were intended to be heard by a superior. The words themselves need not necessarily be discourteous. If they indicate a deliberate intention to be insubordinate or resist lawful authority they may properly be regarded as disrespectful of authority, although courteously expressed. Where for instance a sepoy, having been given a lawful command which does not require immediate compliance, indicates respectfully that he does not intend to comply with it and is at once placed in arrest before being given a chance to comply, he may be charged with an offence under this section though not with an offence under AA.s.41(2)     \",\n",

       " 'THE ARMY ACT, 1950 WITH NOTES  ',\n",
       " '16.  Further a sepoy may in an outburst of temper or excitement use violent language without intending to be in subordinate. Allowance should also be made for the use of coarse expressions by a person of inferior education which might often be used as mere expletives. These expressions might be insubordinate if used by an officer, a JCO or a senior NCO but not so when used by a junior NCO or a sepoy. These points must be considered by a court before convicting an accused of an offence under this clause.  17. As to the use of coarse and abusive language by a person who is intoxicated, see note 6 to AA.s.48. 18.  The words need not necessarily be spoken. If an accused writes a letter containing insubordinate expressions and addresses it to a superior officer, intending the letter to be read by the addressee, a charge would lie under this clause. 19.  The use of what is commonly known as \"bad\" language need not necessarily give rise to a charge either under this section or AA.s.63.  41.  Disobedience to Superior officer.— (1) Any person subject to this act who disobeys in such manner as to show a wilful defiance of authority any lawful command given personally by his superior officer in the execution of his office whether the same is given orally, or in writing or by signal or otherwise shall, on conviction by court-martial be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to fourteen years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.  (2)  Any person subject to this Act who disobeys any lawful command given by his superior officer shall, on conviction by court-martial.  if he commits such offence when on active service, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to fourteen years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned; and if he commits such offence when on active service, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.

       " '1.  Offences under this section, when on active service, should not be dealt with summarily under AA.s.80, 83 or 84. 2.  An offence under this section cannot be made the subject of a joint charge. 3.  Lawful Command.—The command must be a specific command to an individual i.e., it must be capable of individual execution by the person to whom it is addressed and justified by military, as well as by civil, law and usage, e.g., a command addressed by a superior officer to four persons to \"dismiss\" is for the purposes of this section a lawful military command to each of the four persons so addressed. The command must relate to military duty that is to say disobedience to it must tend to impede, delay or prevent a military proceeding. The disobedience must have reference to the time at which the command is to be obeyed. If the command be a lawful command, and demands a prompt and immediate compliance, hesitation or unnecessary delay in obeying it may be sufficient to constitute an offence under this section. A person who on being ordered to do a certain thing at some time, uses words expressing an intention not to obey and is immediately confined, does not commit an offence under this section. He should be charged under AA.s.40(c) or 63 according to the circumstances of the case. A neglect to carry out an order due to misapprehension, or forgetfulness, does not constitute an offence under this section though non-compliance with an order through forgetfulness or negligence would be chargeable under AA.s.63. 4.  Sub sec (1).—(a)  The essential ingredients of this offence are that the disobedience should show a wilful defiance of authority and should be disobedience of a lawful command given personally in the execution of his office by a superior officer; in fact, it would ordinarily be such an offence as would fall under AA.s,37 if two or more persons joined in it. In order, therefore, to convict an accused of an offence under this sub-sec it must be shown (i) that a lawful command was given by a superior officer, (ii) that it was given personally by such officer; (iii) that it was given by such officer in the execution of his office; (iv) that the accused disobeyed it, not from any misunderstanding or slowness but so as to show a wilful defiance of his superior officer\\'s authority.

It is not disobedience in the sense of this section if a sepoy declines to sign his accounts on the grounds that they are incorrect; nor his failure to obey a command where obedience would be physically impossible. (c)  Religious scruples, however, bonafide, afford no justification for disobedience of commands which are clearly lawful. (d)  Disobedience to an order of a general nature, as for instance to a regimental order or a para of regulations, is not chargeable under this section but under AA.s.42(e) or 63.  5. (a) Superior officer; see AA.s.3(xxiii).—A \\'superior officer\\' whose command has been restricted, either by the terms of his commission or by regulations, cannot give a lawful command to a person who is, by the terms of such restrictions, placed outside his control. (b)  Disobedience of a lawful order given by a person who is not a superior officer within the meaning of AA.s.3(xxiii) may be punishable under AA.s.63 if the disobedience was prejudicial to good order and military discipline; for instance, a civilian cannot give a \"lawful command\" under this section to a soldier employed under him; but it may well be the soldier\\'s duty as such to do the act indicated, and, if so, he may be punished for not doing it under AA.s.63. The particulars of the charge should clearly show that the disobedience was prejudicial to good order and military discipline because the soldier had been placed under the orders of the civilian by a superior military authority. (c)  The particulars of the charge must set out the name of the superior officer and a charge for disobeying an order given by two different superior officers would be bad for duplicity.

A court trying an accused for an offence under this sub sec could, if it was not satisfied that the order was given in the execution of the superior\\'s office, find the accused guilty of an offence under sub sec (2) provided that in all other respects an offence under this section had been committed (AA.s.139(7)).  8.  Sub sec. (2).—The offence under this sub sec is a less grave offence when not committed on active service and consists of disobedience of any lawful command given by a superior officer but not accompanied by the essential elements of the graver offence under sub sec (1).  9.  The particulars of the charge must specify the command, the name of the superior officer giving it, the fact of disobedience and if the charge is laid under sub sec (1) also that it was given personally by superior officer in the execution of his office specifying the nature of the offence and the manner in which the disobedience showed a willful defiance of authority.  42.

       " \"NOTES 1.  Clause (a).— For definitions of affray, criminal force and assault, see IPC.ss159 and 349-351 (reproduced in Part III).  An affray differs from assault in that the former cannot be committed in a private place whereas the latter may take place anywhere; further an affray is an offence against the public peace while an assault is an offence against the person of an individual. 2.  A person may be charged under this clause whether the officer who ordered him into arrest was of inferior or superior rank, but where the officer was of superior rank, the offender may be charged under AA.s.40 or 41. Only officers should be charged under this clause. 3.  An accused charged under this clause with using criminal force could be found guilty under AA.s.139 of an attempt to use criminal force or assault. 4.  As to intoxication as a defence to a charge see note 4to AA.s.48. 5.  Clause (b).—A charge may be laid under this clause for assaulting a civil policeman, if the person committing the assault is subject to military law, and has been lawfully placed in the policeman's custody. 6.  Clause (c).—Resistance may be direct violence but threatening words and a threatening attitude might amount to resisting an escort, if the threats were sufficient to deter the escort from arresting the accused. Resistance may also be passive, e.g. a person lying down and refusing to move, if physically able to move, could be said to resist. The particulars of the charge should specify the nature of the resistance. The court will use their military knowledge to determine whether it was the duty of the escort to apprehend the accused or to have him in charge. 7.  Clause (d).—(a) This offence consists of a person quitting barracks, etc., at a time when he had no right to do so, either because he was on duty or under punishment, or because of some regulation or order; and it is immaterial whether the offence was managed by violence, stratagem, disguise, or simply by walking past a sentry unnoticed. The mode in which the act was effected will, however, assist a CO in determining whether a charge be preferred under this clause, or under AA.s. 38(1). The particulars of the charge must show that the absence from barracks etc., was without permission, or otherwise unlawful, and also if the accused was in any way confined to barracks that fact must be alleged in the charge.  (b) In a charge for breaking out of barracks, it must be proved that the accused left the confines of the barracks, as charged. A charge of breaking out of quarters would hold good in the case of a person quartered in one part of a barrack and improperly leaving that part for another part where he had no right to be. .  Clause (e). —(a) The orders specified in this clause mean standing orders or orders having a continuous operation or applicable continuously over a period of time to all officers, JCOs, WOs and OR present in a certain geographical area, such as Command, Area, Sub Area or Station or in a certain military formation such as Army, Corps Division or Brigade. Disobedience of a specific order in the nature of a command should be dealt with under AA.s.41 and non-compliance, through forgetfulness or negligence, with an order to do some specific act at a future time under AA.s.63.  (b)  Ignorance of the order is no excuse, if the order is one which the accused ought in the, ordinary course to know. But a misapprehension reasonably arising from want of clarity in the order is a ground for exculpation. The existence of the orders and the fact of the neglect must be proved. The order contravened, (or a certified copy where such copy is admissible under AA.s.142(4) must be produced on oath to the court and the court will make a record in the proceedings of its having been so produced. A written order cannot be proved by oral testimony. Evidence must also be given to show that the order was duly posted or brought to the notice of the accused, or that he was otherwise in a position to be acquainted with its contents.

(c)  Concealment of venereal disease is to be dealt with under this clause if standing orders to the effect have been published that a person subject to AA. who is suffering from VD must report sick without delay. Also see Regs Army para 351. 9.  Clause (f). —As to the definition, appointment and duties of provost-marshals see AA.ss.3(xx) and 107. Under AA.s.107(4) a provost-marshal includes a provost-marshal appointed under any law for the time being in force relating to the government of the Navy or Air Force and any person legally exercising authority under him of on his behalf. 10.  The court may exercise their military knowledge as to whether a person was a provost-marshal, or a person legally exercising authority under or on behalf of the provost-marshal but it will be open to the accused to show that the person he is charged with impeding was not properly appointed provost-marshal or was not lawfully acting on his behalf.  11.  It is frequently of the highest importance to conciliate the inhabitants of the country, where the troops happen to be, and to induce them to bring provisions and, supplies. From this point of view an offence, which in other circumstances would be trival, may require severe punishment.  43.  Fraudulent enrolment.—  Any person subject to this Act who commits any of the following offences, that is to say, —  (a)  without having obtained a regular discharge from the corps or department to which he belongs, or otherwise fulfilled the conditions enabling him to enroll or enter, enrolls himself in, or enters the same or any other corps or department or any part of the naval or air forces of India or the Territorial Army; or  (b)  is concerned in the enrolment in any part of the Forces of any person when he knows or has reason to believe such person to be so circumstanced that by enrolling he commits an offence against this Act; shall, on conviction by court-martial, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.

Fraudulent enrolment like desertion is an offence, trial in respect of which is not barred by AA.s.122 except in the case of a person, other than an officer who has subsequently to the commission of the offence served continuously in an exemplary manner for not less than three years with any portion of the regular Army; for exemplary manner, see Regs Army para 465. 3.  Clause (a). —For definition of 'corps' see AR187(1). 4.  Department; see AA.s.3(ix). 5.  (a) A person who leaves one corps or department and enrolls himself in another does not prima facie commit the offence of deserting the service, though he irregularly and improperly exchanges one branch of that service for another If however at the time of leaving his first corps or department, he had no intention of re-enrolling himself, and only did so as an afterthought, or if he absented himself to avoid a particular military service, e.g., service abroad, his offence is desertion, though a convict on a charge framed under this section would also be legal In deciding under which section a charge should be framed, the time which elapsed between the two acts will be an important element for consideration. In doubtful case the charge should be framed under this clause. (b)  If the offender is charged with desertion, he should be tried in his original corps or department.

As a rule he should be tried in that corps or department in which it is intended to retain him.  (c)  It will be noticed that the offence under this clause can be committed by a person who belongs to a corps or department and enrolls himself again in the same corps or department. This clause is meant to meet the case of the larger corps and departments (e.g. the Army Service Corps) where a man might otherwise leave one portion of the corps or department and enroll himself in another with impunity. 6.  The clause does not deal with the case of a sailor or airman who enrolls into any corps or department of the regular Army but merely gives the converse case of a person subject to AA enrolling in the Air Force or T.A. or entering the Navy. Sailors or airmen who enroll in any corps or department of the regular Army should be dealt with under AA.s.44. Similarly a member of the Territorial Army who enrolls himself into any corps or department of the regular Army when such member is not subject to AA under AA.s.2(l)(e) cannot be charged under this clause although he may be charged under AA.s.44 for making a false answer if such be the case. 7. As to forfeiture of service towards pension or gratuity on conviction for this offence, see P and A Regs, and Pension Regs, where the conditions under which service so forfeited may be restored are also laid down. 8.  Proof of fraudulent enrolment may be given either. —(a) orally by a witness who was present when the accused was enrolled on the second enrolment, or  (b)  by production by a witness, who can identify on oath the accused as the person named therein, of the original enrolment paper or a copy of his enrolment paper purporting to be certified to be a true copy by the officer, having the custody of the enrolment paper; AA.s.141(2). Evidence must also be given that at the time the accused enrolled himself; he was then serving. This can be proved by a witness orally or by production of the earlier enrolment paper as above. 9.  Clause (b). —'the Forces'; see AA.s.3(xi). 10.  'So circumstanced'. —The term implies that where he is subject to AA, so that he is guilty of fraudulent enrolment under AA.s.43(a) or where, having previously served, he again enrolls without declaring the circumstances of his previous service, so that he commits an offence under AA.s.44.  44.  False answers on enrolment.— Any person having become subject to this Act who is discovered to have made at the time of enrolment a willfully false answer to any question set forth in the prescribed form of enrolment which has been put to him by the enrolling officer before whom he appears for the purpose of being enrolled shall, on conviction by court-martial, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.  \",\n",

This is essential since at the time the offence is committed the person is not actually subject to AA; as he does not become so subject until he has signed the enrolment paper (AA.s.14). 2.  A person charged with \"fraudulent enrolment\" under AA.s.43(a) should not also be charged under this section with \"false answer\" made on the occasion of such enrolment. 3.

Unbecoming conduct- Any officer, junior commissioned officer or warrant officer who behaves in a manner unbecoming his position and the character expected of him shall, on conviction by court-martial, if he is an officer, be liable to be cashiered or to suffer such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned; and, if he is a junior commissioned officer or a warrant officer, be liable to be dismissed or to suffer such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.  NOTES 1. An offence under this section should not be dealt with summarily under AA.s.83 or 84. 2.  For behaviour to be blameworthy under this section, it must be unbecoming both the accused's position and the character expected of him as an officer/JCO/WO i.e., his refusal to be swayed by considerations other than duty to the service does not, as the word is commonly understood, admit of different degrees or standards at any rate in that class and cannot therefore vary with his position i.e., the rank or appointment held by him except when the behaviour complained of is of a social character i.e., it offends the accepted rules of social behaviour and thus is unbecoming the character from a moral view point, in which case the culpability would depend upon the position held by the accused. Where behaviour complained of is not punishable under this section, a charge may lie under AA.s.63, if such conduct is prejudicial both to good order and military discipline. 3.  The offence under this section must be distinguished from the offence of disgraceful conduct of a cruel, indecent or unnatural kind under AA.s.46(a). As a rule a charge should not be preferred under this section where such behaviour amounts to a specific offence under any other section of AA. The conduct is not brought within the scope of this section by merely applying to it the statutory language; and a court is not warranted in convicting unless of the opinion that the conduct proved was unbecoming of the accused's position and the character expected of him as an officer etc., having regard to its nature and to the circumstances in which it took place. 4.  This section is not applicable to civilians with relative rank and subject to AA under sec. 2(l)(i). 5.  This section is frequently invoked in cases where an officer has given stumer cheques. Such a charge should only be preferred where it is clear from the evidence from the bank that the officer acted in such reckless manner as is tantamount to fraud. 6.  There can be no attempt to commit this offence as unbecoming conduct would include the act as well as an attempt to do such act.  46.  Certain forms of disgraceful conduct. — Any person subject to this Act who commits any of the following offences, that is to say, — (a)  is guilty of any disgraceful conduct of a cruel, indecent or unnatural kind; or  (b)  malingers, or feigns, or produces disease or infirmity in himself, or intentionally delays his cure or aggravates his disease or infirmity; or (c)  with intent to render himself or any other person unfit for service voluntarily causes hurt to himself or that person; shall, on conviction by court-martial, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.  \",\n",

       " \"3.  In the absence of any evidence of a definite act of indecency or attempted indecency, mere words that an indecent or unnatural act was committed are not sufficient to constitute an offence under this clause though a charge may probably lie under AA.s.63. 4.  Disgraceful conduct of an unnatural kind ordinarily implies the commission or at least the attempted commission of an offence under IPC.s.377. Therefore, in framing charges under this clause, the charge should invariably be laid for disgraceful conduct of an indecent kind unless the evidence permits of the averment in the particulars that an unnatural offence as ordinarily understood was committed or at least attempted 5. To allege in a charge under this clause conduct of an indecent and unnatural kind would be bad for duplicity, since they are two separate offences: AR 30. 6.  Cruel.— Cruelty usually involves the doing of some positive act, such as beating or killing or torturing. In most cases therefore the conduct alleged will amount to an offence under some other section of AA. But there are circumstances in which cruelty can be charged against a person who has culpably failed to do what he ought to have done e.g., where a definite duty was imposed upon a person to do something and he failed to perform that duty. 7.  There can be no attempt to commit this offence. See note 1 to AA.s.45. 8.  Clause (b)— To 'malinger' is to pretend illness or infirmity which does not exist, in order to escape duty. To 'feign' disease or infirmity means that the accused person exhibits appearances resembling the genuine symptoms of disease or infirmity which, to his knowledge, are not due to such disease or infirmity, but have been produced artificially or purposes of deceit; e.g., simulating fits or mental disease. To 'produce' disease is willfully to cause genuine disease to develop, e.g., by the infection of microbes or poisonous drugs. The involuntary production, aggravation, or prolongation of delirium tremens by intemperate habits, or of sexually transmitted diseases by immoral conduct, does not render a person liable under this clause; but sec note 7(c) to AA.s.42 as to concealment of sexually transmitted diseases. Similarly a person who refuses to undergo a surgical operation or to be inoculated or vaccinated does not incur any liability under this clause or AA.s.41 as any puncturing or cutting of the skin, mucuous  membrance or tissues amounts to a surgical operation nor can he be punished for refusing to allow anaesthetic to be administered. 9.  'Intentionally'. —In a case under this clause and clause (c), evidence must be given of the intent required therein but it would be sufficient to raise a presumption of that intention if the act in question was shown to have been done willfully and not accidentally 10.  Clause (c). —Intent: see note 9 above. It is usual to prefer an alternative charge under AA.s.63 to a charge under this clause alleging that the accused improperly or negligently rendered himself temporarily unfit for duty. 11.  For the definition of the term 'voluntarily causing hurt': See IPC.ss.319 and 321(Part III). 12.  'Any other person' means any other person subject to AA and not a civilian.  13. Offences of this nature, even when committed in the presence of the enemy should be charged under this clause and not under AA.s.34(c).  47. Ill-treating a subordinate. —Any officer, junior commissioned officer, warrant officer or non-commissioned officer who uses criminal force to or otherwise ill-treats any person subject to this Act, being his subordinate in rank or position, shall, on conviction by court-martial, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.   NOTES 1. (a) An offence under this section should not be dealt with summarily under AA s.80 83 or 84.  (b)  A sepoy cannot commit an offence under this section.

Using criminal force or ill-treatment provided for by this section need not necessarily be consequent on or connected with the superior status of the accused. The only essentials necessary to constitute an offence under this section are— (a) that the accused used criminal force to or ill-treated a person subject to AA. subordinate to him in rank or position; and (b) that the accused was acquainted with the identity of the person against Whom he used criminal force or whom he ill-treated. 4.  It is an offence under this section for one NCO to use criminal force or ill-treat another who is not his superior in rank or position. Where two NCOs of equal rank are concerned, evidence must be led to prove that the person against whom criminal force was used was junior to the accused. Where the two are of equal seniority or where one sepoy strikes another, the charge should be laid under AA.s.63 or 69. 5. Where the person against whom criminal force is alleged to be used in a sentry, the charge should be preferred under AA.s.36(a) and not under this section.  48.  Intoxication. —  (1) Any person subject to this Act who is found in a state of intoxication, whether on duty or not, shall, on conviction by court-martial, if he is an officer, be liable to be cashiered or to suffer such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned; and, if he is not an officer, be liable, subject to the provisions of sub-section (2), to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.  (2) Where an offence of being intoxicated is committed by a person other than an officer when not on active service or not on duty, the period of imprisonment awarded shall not exceed six months.  NOTES  1.  Intoxication may be induced by opium or any similar drug, as well as by liquor. This section creates only one single offence, viz. intoxication, and in all cases, whether the act was committed on duty or not on duty, the charge should be \"intoxication\". If the offence was committed on duty, or after; the accused had been warned for duty, the fact that the offence was so committed and the nature of the duty should be specified in the particulars of the charge as the character of the offence, from a military point of view, and therefore its proper punishment is materially affected by the circumstance. 2.  Intoxication will be regarded as having the ordinary meaning attached to it in civil life i.e., what an ordinary reasonable person would consider to be such and the fact that an offender is capable or incapable of performing his duty is not a decisive or exclusive test of drunkenness or sobriety. It is, however, one of the tests which should be applied by the court. 3.  A person suspected of being intoxicated cannot be put through any drill or test for the purpose of ascertaining his condition; (Regs Army para 393(b)). As such the best evidence in such a charge is the direct stated evidence of witness(s). 4.  For instructions as to the treatment of a person in arrest for being intoxicated see Regs Army para 393(a). 5.  The offence of intoxication is one which cannot be tried jointly. 6.  Nothing can justify a person subject to AA using criminal force to or assaulting a superior, and great care is therefore enjoined to be taken to avoid bringing intoxicated persons in contact with their superiors. Mere abusive and violent language used by an intoxicated person, as the result of being taken into custody, should not be used as the ground for framing a charge of using threatening or insubordinate language to a superior officer under AA.s.40(b) or (c). If a court-martial is considered necessary, the charge should be framed under this section, the language being treated as in the nature of riotous conduct only, and to that extent aggravating the offence.

NOTES 1.  Where the offence is wilful, the charge should not be dealt with summarily under AA.s.80, 83 or 84. 2.  (a) Where a doubt exists as to the accused having acted wilfully, he should be charged with having acted without reasonable excuse. (b) An act or omission is wilful if it is done or made by a person with the intention of allowing the escape of a person committed to his charge or whom it is his duty to guard or keep. (c) If the charge is one of wilfully committing the offence, the court may, if it is not satisfied that the act was wilful, make a special finding under AA.s.139(7) that the accused acted without reasonable excuse. 3.  \\'Without proper authority\\'s —(a) These words are in the nature of an exception and it will rest on the accused to show that he had the proper authority. (b) The court may use their military knowledge (AA.s.134) with respect to whether any authority alleged by the accused to, exist was or was not sufficient. 4.  \\'Any person\\'. —The person improperly released or allowed to escape need not be a person subject to AA. 5.  A deserter or absentee without leave who surrenders himself, and who is being conducted by a NCO to rejoin his unit, is not \"committed to the charge\" of the NCO conducting him within the meaning of this section, but it may well be the NCO\\'s duty to \"keep or guard him\". It will be noticed that, for the purpose of clause (a), the person released must have been committed to the charge of the accused, while for the purpose of clause (b) the person allowed to escape need only have been a person whom the accused was under a duty to keep or guard. The offender under clause (a) must be in the command of the guard, piquet, patrol or post, and previously have had the released person committed to his charge; while under clause (b) the offender who allows a person to escape need not have any such command.  50.  Irregularity in connection With arrest or confinement. —Any person subject to this Act who commits any of the following offences, that is to say,-  (a) Unnecessarily detains a person in arrest or confinement without bringing him to trial, or fails to bring his case before the proper authority for investigation; or  (b) having committed a person to military custody fails without reasonable cause to deliver at the time of such committal, or as soon as practicable, and in any case within forty-eight hours thereafter, to the          157  THE ARMY ACT, 1950 WITH NOTES  officer or other person into whose custody the person arrested is committed, an account in writing signed by himself of the offence with which the person so committed is charged; shall on conviction by court-martial, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.

Clause (a): —In support of a charge laid under this clause for either of the offences therein created the prosecutor will have to prove the facts which either show or enable the court to infer that the accused could have brought the person under arrest or in confinement to trial or brought his case before the proper authority for investigation. If these are proved the court may infer that it was unnecessary to keep the person, in question, in custody in the absence of an explanation by the accused. As to \"the proper Authority\" see AR2(d). See also Regs Army para 408(b). 2.  AR 27(3) prohibits an accused being detained in military custody which includes open arrest for longer than 2 months without the sanction of the COAS and for longer than 3 months without the approval of the Central Government. 3.  Clause (b): —For definition of military custody, see AA.s.3(xiii).  4.  When a guard etc., commander   wilfully or without reasonable excuse refuses to receive a person committed to his charge, he commits an offence under AA.s.49(a) in respect of his improper refusal. The fact that no account in writing of the type required in this clause was received by the guard etc., commander from the person committing the person at the time of committal or within 48 hours thereafter would not entitle the guard commander to refuse custody or charge or to effect the subsequent release of any such person, 5.

The term 'lawful custody' in this section means not only military custody as defined in AA.s.3(xiii) but any lawful custody; so that a person subject to AA may be convicted under this section when escaping or attempting to escape from a police officer who has under AA.s.105(2) arrested him as a suspected deserter. Similarly when a person is held by the Provost Marshal or a person legally exercising authority under him or on his behalf under AA.107, he may be charged with an offence under this section. 2.  (a) As military custody includes open arrest, a person escaping or attempting to escape while in open arrest could be charged under this section. (b) A person undergoing field punishment is in lawful custody within the meaning of this section although he is not in arrest. Care therefore must be taken, when framing a charge under this section to ensure that the particulars alleged correspond with the statement of offence. (c) Confinement to the lines is not lawful custody for the purposes of this section. 3.  A person subject to AA, who escapes from arrest and absents himself without leave, may be charged with, and convicted of, both under this section, and of the subsequent desertion or absence without leave; under AA.s.38(1) or 39(a). 4.

Before trial is ordered on charges under this section, reference should be made to the DJAG Command concerned: See Regs Army paras 432 and 458. 2.  A person charged before a court-martial with an offence under clause (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section may be found guilty of any other of these offences with which he might have been charged (AA.s.139(5)). 3.  Clause (a): —(a) For definition of theft see IPC.s.378 in part III. (b) \\'Any property\\' means any moveable property.  (c) See IPC.s.27 for the implication of the term \"Possession\". 4.  (a) If the stolen property has been recovered, it should be produced in court and identified by its owner and by any other witnesses who mention it in their evidence. If it has not been recovered its value or approximate value should be entered in the particulars of the charge and proved in evidence so that the court, if it convicts the accused, may add an award of stoppages to its sentence. (b) where an offender is sentenced by court-martial to be placed under stoppages in respect of any property stolen, etc., by him, due allowance must be made, in enforcing such stoppages, for money, or the value of any property found upon him and appropriated by way of restitution under AA.s.151. 5. Captured enemy property becomes the property of the Government. 6.  (a)  One of the essential ingredients of the offence of theft is that the property must be taken out of the possession of another person. It is not necessary that the property should have been owned by such person. When a person has the \\'physical\\' or \"constructive possession of property, dishonest removal of the same from the possession of such person without his consent constitutes theft.  (b)  Stealing from a person subject to military law is regarded as a particularly disgraceful military offence, considering that in the daily routine of barrack life, persons must constantly leave exposed their arms, uniform and equipment as well as their private property, such as money, watches, etc., trusting to the honour of their comrades. 7.  For the presumptions which a court may draw in respect of recent possession of stolen property, see IEA.s.114 illustration (a).  ',\n",

Clause (b): (a) For civil offence of criminal misappropriation see IPC.s.403 (Part III). (b) 'Any property' means any moveable property. (c) For definition of 'dishonestly' see IPC.s.24.

(b) 'Converts to his own use’. —There must be actual conversion of the thing appropriated to the use of some person other than the person entitled thereto. Mere retention of property would not warrant a conviction under this clause; unless there is evidence that the accused used that property; for instance when a clerk received certain sums on various dates but entered them in the accounts on each occasion some days after and it was found that the clerk was not in difficulties and did not use the amount, the mere retention by him of the money for some days would not constitute an offence under this clause. \",\n",
       " \"12.  Difference between theft and criminal misappropriation. —In theft the object of the offender always is to take property which is in the possession of a person out of that person's possession; and the offence is complete as soon as the offender has moved the property in order to dishonest taking of it. In criminal misappropriation, the offender is already in possession of the property; and is either innocently or lawfully in possession of it, because either he has found it or it is entrusted to him, or his possession, if not strictly lawful, is not punishable as an offence because he has acquired it under some mistaken notion of right in himself or of, consent given by another. It is the dishonest misappropriation or conversion to his use that constitutes the offence. 13. (a) A mere error or irregularity in accounts or a mistaken mis- application of property does not constitute an offence under this clause. There must be an intent to defraud on the part of the accused either for the benefit of himself or some other person. This must be particularly remembered in the case, for example, of an NCO's accounts getting into confusion through the neglect or carelessness of his superiors. Neglect or failure to supervise that the account is maintained strictly according to service regulations frequently leads to loss of funds and property, and also exposes the subordinates to grave temptation in relation to their accounts.  (b) To secure a conviction on a charge under this clause it is not necessary for the prosecution to prove that the accused intended permanently to deprive the public or other owner of the property, provided the court is satisfied that the accused or some other person benefited and that the owner of the property suffered. In other words, a person may still be guilty of the offence, even though he has repaid the money which he had misappropriated, provided that at the time of such misappropriation he had a dishonest intent. The term dishonest misappropriation' includes temporary as well as permanent misappropriation of that description. See IPC.s.403 explanation 1. (c) If no evidence is forthcoming as to the particular mode of misappropriation, the court may, in the absence of explanation from the accused, infer that the property was misappropriated from the fact of its not having been properly utilised or accounted for. 14. Each instance of misappropriation should be in a separate charge unless they all form part of the same transaction. 15. The value of the property alleged to have been misappropriated should be entered in the particulars of the charge and proved in evidence so that the court, if it convicts the accused, may award stoppages.  16. Clause(c):Criminal breach of trust; for definition, see IPC,s.405. 17.  (a) To constitute an offence under, this clause, there must be dishonest misappropriation by a person in whom confidence is placed as to the custody or management \",\n",
       " '160',\n",
       " 'THE ARMY ACT, 1950 WITH NOTES  of the property in respect of which the breach of trust is charged. There must be an entrustment which, in its most general significance, imports a handing over the possession for some purpose which may not imply the conferring of any proprietary right at all.  (b) A person is said to be entrusted with dominion over property when it remains legally in the owner\\'s possession but he is given a limited authority to deal with it. 18.Criminal misappropriation and criminal breach of trust :-In criminal misappropriation the property comes into the possession of the offender by some casualty or otherwise, and he, afterwards misappropriates it. In the case of criminal breach of trust the offender is lawfully entrusted with the property and he dishonestly misappropriates the same or wilfully suffers any other person to do so, instead of discharging the trust attached to it. 19.  Clause (d): Dishonestly—See IPC.s.24. Also see IPC.s.23. 20. The offence of dishonestly receiving property under this clause has practically the same meaning as under IPC.s.411 except that this clause is only limited to property of the description mentioned in clause (a). 21. Receives or retains.—A person cannot be convicted of receiving if he had no guilty knowledge at the time of receipt. But he is guilty of \\'retaining\\' if he subsequently knows or has reason to believe that the property was obtained by theft, criminal misappropriation or criminal breach of trust. The offence of dishonest retention may be completed without any guilty knowledge at the time of receipt. A person who is proved to have stolen etc., property cannot be convicted of retaining it. 22 .Clause(e):Wilfully destroys or injures.—A charge for destroying or injuring the property here mentioned must be laid under this clause, and not under AA.s.69. The prosecutor must adduce evidence which will either prove, or enable the court to infer, that the injury was not accidental or done by some other person. If the injury appears to be the result of neglect, it will be for the court to determine whether the neglect was wilful and intended to injure the property, or was mere carelessness. In the latter case no offence under this clause would be committed. The pecuniary amount of damage or injury caused must be stated in the particulars of the charge and proved in evidence by calling an expert witness if necessary, to enable \\'the court to award stoppages in case of conviction. 23.  Clause (f): \\'Does any other thing\\'.— An act or omission which would fall under any other clause or any other section of AA should not be made the subject matter of a charge under this clause. But in doubtful cases, the charge should be laid under this clause. 24. (a) \\'With intent to defraud\\'. —A person is said to do a thing fraudulently if he does that thing with intent to defraud but not, otherwise. IPC.s.25   (b) The terms \\'fraud\\' and \\'defraud\\' are not found defined in the IPC. The word \\'defraud\\' is of double meaning in the sense that it either may or may not imply deprivation. Whenever the words \\'fraud\\' or \\'intent to defraud\\' or \\'fraudulently\\' occur in the definition of a crime two elements at least are essential to the commission of the crime; namely first, deceit or an intention to deceive or in some cases mere secrecy; and secondly, either actual injury or possible injury or an intent to expose some person either to actual injury or to a risk of possible injury by means of that deceit or secrecy. This intent is very seldom the only or the principal intention entertained by; the fraudulent person, whose principal object in nearly every case is his own advantage. The \"injurious deception\" is usually intended only as a means to an end, though this does not prevent it from being intentional. A practically conclusive test as to the fraudulent character of a deception for criminal purposes is this; did the author of the deceit derive any advantage from it, which he could not have had if the truth had been known ? If so, it is hardly possible that advantage should not have had an equivalent in loss, or risk of loss to some one else; and if so, there was fraud.  (c) A general intention to defraud, without the intention of causing wrongful gain to one person or wrongful loss to another, would be sufficient to support a conviction.

A person may have an intent to defraud, and yet there may not be any person who could be defrauded by his act. It should, however, be noted that an intent only to deceive is not enough. (d) When it is material to prove an intent to defraud, evidence may be given of similar offences by the accused.  25 . Wrongful loss or wrongful gain: See IPC.s.23 (Part III). 26.  (a) In order to constitute an offence under this clause, it is not sufficient to couple the description of an act which can bear an innocent construction with an averment of intent to defraud. The act alleged to have been committed with intent to defraud must itself appear from the particulars of the charge to be a wrong act though it need not necessarily amount to an offence under the ordinary criminal law. (b) Mere irregularity in accounts, due to incompetence or ignorance of bookkeeping, would not be sufficient under this clause, to constitute an offence as no fraudulent conduct is involved. However acts such as, with intent to defraud, presenting for signature acquittance rolls, containing entries known to be false; or charging money for railway warrants; tickets, or vouchers, to which a person is entitled free of charge, would all amount to offences of a fraudulent nature for the purposes of this clause.  53. Extortion and Corruption. —Any person subject to this Act who commits any of the following offences, that is to say, —  (a) commits extortion; or  (b) without proper authority exacts from any person money, provisions or service; shall, on conviction by court-martial, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.

(a) A charge under clause (a) or (b) of making away with or losing etc., property not mentioned in those clauses e.g., mess property or property of a comrade would be bad though if the act amounted to theft, dishonest misappropriation or criminal breach of trust, it would be punishable under AA.s.52 or 69; if the facts show wilful act or neglect, the person might in certain circumstances be charged with an offence under AA.s.63. (b) Any other thing should be ejusdem  generis i.e., part of the accused\\'s kit which he is bound to maintain or his general military equipment supplied by the Government; such \\'other thing\\' should be specified in the statement and particulars of the charge. 4. Clothing in this clause may include hospital clothing issued to a person subject to AA, or civilian clothing issued from military sources. 5. Whenever it is desired that the offender should, on conviction of an offence under this clause or clause(b), be awarded stoppages under AA.s.71(1) in respect of the value of the articles which need be made good to the Govt/public, then the value must be stated in the particulars of the charge [AR30(6) ] and proved as follows: (a) Value of an article having an official value will be proved by calling a witness who can, on oath, estimate the value (inclusive of authorised departmental expenses) of the article at the date of the offence upon the basis of its age and/or condition and by reference to the regulations which should be produced for fixing the value of the article at that age or in that condition. (b) When the article has not an official value, competent evidence is required to prove the approximate value. (c)When an article has been damaged but not rendered unserviceable, competent evidence is required to prove the pecuniary amount of the damage, which will be either the cost of repairing it, if it can be repaired, or the cost of repair plus any ultimate loss of value due to the act of the accused. 6. Clause (b).—This is not intended to punish a person for a deficiency in his kit occasioned by accident or mere carelessness but for loss by culpable neglect. On the other hand, the fact that a person has not got his arms, service necessaries, etc., at a time when it was his duty to have them (i.e., at a kit inspection), is prima facie evidence of his having lost them by neglect. The onus of proving \"neglect\" always remains on the prosecution. But once the loss is proved, the court is entitled to expect the accused to offer some explanation of it, and if he gives none, it is open to the court to conclude that the loss must have been due to his negligence. If he gives an explanation which may reasonably be true and which if true is inconsistent with negligence, even if the court is not convinced of its truth, he must be acquitted, since a reasonable doubt as to his negligence then remains. 7.  Where a court of inquiry (as laid down in AA.s.106) has been held and has found a person to be deficient in certain articles, then upon his trial under this clause a certified copy of the record in the regimental books, on IAFD-918, showing that such articles were deficient is prima facie evidence that they were deficient and of their value, if stated (AA.s.142(3) and (4)). If no evidence, except IAFD-918 is obtainable, the prosecution would be justified in proceeding on that alone, and if no evidence is given on the part of the accused to disprove the facts stated therein, the court may convict. Where, however, the accused gives or produces evidence in contradiction of the declaration of the court of inquiry with regard to any of the articles in question, it will become necessary for the prosecution to produce other evidence in support of its case in so far as such articles are concerned for which purpose the court might, if necessary, grant an adjournment under AR 82. If for any reasonable cause, such as lapse of time since the deficiency arose, no witnesses are available to rebut the evidence produced by the accused, ',\n",

       " 'THE ARMY ACT, 1950 WITH NOTES  the court must use its discretion as to its finding in respect of the articles in question. In all cases. where IAFD-918 is not produced at the trial evidence must be produced to show that at some previous specified date the accused has been in possession of the articles alleged to be deficient. In cases of desertion or absence without leave the form will usually show as missing some articles which the person in fact brings back with him. The court must not, of course, convict him in respect of articles so returned if in serviceable condition or those the value of which has not to be made good to the public. 8 losing by neglect the property of a comrade, or a decoration, is not an offence under this clause as that class of property or decoration is not mentioned therein.

Before trial is ordered on charges under this section, reference should be made to the DJAG Command concerned. (b)  This section refers to strictly official documents. 2. Clauses (a) and (b).—A report (which must be in writing), return, certificate or other document mentioned herein must be one executed by the accused in his capacity as a person subject to AA and not in some civil capacity. The 'other document' which should be ejusdem generis, should be specified in the statement and particulars of the charge. A trivial error in the report should not, in the absence of fraud or bad faith, be made the ground of a charge under these clauses. 3.  'Made by him'. —Making a document means creating or bringing it into existence e.g., writing or typing it as distinguished from sealing, signing or otherwise executing it. 4.  In determining whether or not it was the duty of the accused to ascertain the accuracy of the report, etc., referred to in the charge, the court may use their military knowledge (AA.s.134). 5.  (a) If a person makes false entries as to payments made in a book which it was his duty to keep in his official capacity he may be charged with knowingly making false statement under clause (a) or, if it can be shown that he intended to defraud by means of the entries, he may be charged with knowingly making a fraudulent statement. Similarly, if he omits to make in the book entries of payments made by him or to him he may; if the evidence justifies such a course, be charged with knowingly making such omissions with intent to defraud under clause (b). (b) When the accused has on the same occasion made a number of fraudulent entries on an acquittance roll, etc., an omnibus charge under AA. s.52(f) would be preferable to a number of charges under clause (a). 6.  Knowingly. —See note 18 to AA. s.34. 7.  It is wrong to make a statement made by an accused in defence or in explanation of an offence imputed to him, the subject of a charge against him, such statement or explanation is strictly analogous to a plea of 'not guilty' before a court-martial, thus casting the burden of proof on the other side, and the accused is at liberty to make at any preliminary inquiry the best excuse he can. 8.  Clause (c). —The suppression, etc., of a document is not an offence under this clause if it is affected only with intent to deceive and not to defraud. The question as to the duty of the accused to preserve or produce the document will be determined by the court using their military knowledge. The particulars of a charge under this clause should show the capacity or appointment on account of which it was the accused's duty to produce or preserve the document. 9.  Clause (e). —(a) Other advantage or privilege must be of a similar kind. (b) obtaining pension or other such advantage may be for himself or any other person whether subject to AA or not.  58.

A person subject to AA. who fails to attend the taking of summary of evidence when ordered to do so can be tried under AA.s.41 or 63 and not under this section, which deals with court-martial. 6. (a) Wilfully or without reasonable excuse: for definition see note2to AA.s.49.   (b)  For special finding, see AA.s.139(7). 7.  Clause (b). —(a)  A person who for reasons of sincerity of which the court is satisfied, refuses to take an oath, must be given the opportunity of making an affirmation; see AA.s.131(2) and AR 140. The offence is not complete unless there is proof of a refusal both to take the oath and to make an affirmation provided option so to do is given to the accused. The charges of refusing to take an oath legally required by a court-martial to be taken and refusing to make an affirmation legally required by a court-martial to be made; may, therefore, be properly drawn in the alternative. 8.  Clause (c)— See IEA.s.123-124 which deal with privilege of official documents. Also see IEAs.162. When a witness is directed by summons to produce a document which is in his possession or power, he must bring it to court, notwithstanding any objection that he may have with regard to its production or admissibility. After this has been done it rests solely with the court to hear the objection or the claim as to privilege, and to decide whether it should be allowed. 9.  Clause (d). — Because a person is competent to give evidence, he cannot be compelled to answer every question he may be asked when giving evidence and which is relevant to the matter in issue. For instance, on an incriminating question being put to a witness, he is entitled to ask to be excused from answering it, and if after he has asked to be excused, the court compels him to answer (as they are entitled to do) his answer can not be proved against him at any criminal proceedings except a prosecution for giving false evidence by such answer; see IEA.s.132. 10.  Clause (e). —A court-martial begins to sit from the time the members take their seats for the purposes of trial, even before they are sworn/affirmed, and anything which would be a contempt after the court was sworn/affirmed would be a contempt once the members have so taken their seats. 11.

For deductions authorised by or under AA see AA.ss.90. 91 and AR 205. 3.  AA.s.90(c) also makes provision for penal deductions to be made from the pay and allowances of an officer to make good any sum which has unlawfully been retained or withheld by him but recovery under that clause does not require disciplinary action.

If an accused is charged under this section with wilfully damaging an aircraft he may be found guilty of damaging it without reasonable excuse under AA.s.139(7) if the evidence justifies this course.  63.  Violation of good order and discipline. — Any person subject to this Act who is guilty of any act or omission which, though not specified in this Act, is prejudicial to good order and military discipline shall, on conviction by court-martial, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.  NOTES  1.  As a rule a charge should not be preferred under this section where special provision for the offence is made elsewhere in AA. In a proper case, however, an alternative charge may be added under this section. 2.  A charge under this section must recite its actual words, i.e., there must be charged an \"act\" or \"omission\" \"prejudicial to good order and military discipline\". But, of course, an act or omission is not brought within the scope of the section by merely applying to it the statutory language; and a court is not warranted in convicting unless of the opinion that the act, etc., proved was prejudicial both to good order and to military discipline, having regard to its nature and to the circumstances in which it took place. 3. (a) \"An omission\" to be punishable under this section must amount to neglect which is wilful or culpable. If wilful, i.e., deliberate it is clearly blameworthy. If it is not wilful, it may or may not be blameworthy, and the court must consider the whole circumstances of the case and, in particular, the responsibility of the accused. A high degree of care can rightly be demanded of a person who is in charge of a motor vehicle or public money or property, or who is handling firearms or explosives, where a slight degree of negligence may involve loss or danger to life; in such circumstances a small degree of negligence may be blameworthy. On the other hand, neglect which results from mere forgetfulness, error of judgment or inadvertence, in relation to a matter which does not rightly demand a very high degree of care, would not be judged blameworthy so as to justify conviction and punishment. The essential thing for the court to consider is whether in the whole circumstances of the case as they existed at the time of the offence the degree of neglect proved is such as, having regard to their military knowledge of the amount of care which ought to have been exercised, renders the neglect substantially blameworthy and deserving of punishment.  170  THE ARMY ACT, 1950 WITH NOTES  (b)  Negligently.—Negligence has been defined by judicial pronouncements as \"the omission to do something which a reasonable man guided upon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do and as \"doing some act which a person of ordinary care and skill would not do under the circumstances\"  4. The following are a few instances of offences not uncommonly charged under this section:   Negligent performance of duties connected with money or stores resulting in a deficiency and loss. Being in improper possession of public property or of property belonging to a comrade (where there is no evidence of actual theft) Improperly using Government transport and petrol for private purposes. Borrowing money from persons under his command, gambling, and other cases of disobedience of regulations, which are not published as regimental orders (see note to AA.s.42(e)). Negligently wounding or injuring self or others.  Improperly using or obtaining railway warrants. Sending an anonymous letter to his commanding officer. Neglect of duty when a sentry, on guard, etc.  Causing a disturbance in the lines. Stating a falsehood to a superior officer.  Using criminal force to a comrade,  5.  AA recognises no such offence as \"making a frivolous complaint\"; but the repetition of baseless complaints may amount to an offence under this section; so too may a complaint so framed as to be offensive or indicative of insubordination, etc.  64. Miscellaneous offences.—  Any person subject to this Act who commits any of the following offences, that is to say, —  (a)  being in command at any post or on the march, and receiving a complaint that any one under his command has beaten or otherwise maltreated or oppressed any person, or has disturbed any fair or market, or committed any riot or trespass, fails to have due reparation made to the injured person or to report the case to the proper authority; or  (b)  by defiling any place, of worship, or otherwise, intentionally insults the religion or wounds the religious feelings of any person; or  (c)  attempts to commit suicide, and in such attempt does any act towards the commission of such offence; or  (d)  being below the rank of warrant officer, when off duty, appears, without proper authority, in or about camp or cantonments, or in or about, or when going to or returning from, any town or bazar, carrying a rifle, sword or other offensive weapon; or  (e)  directly or indirectly accepts or obtains, or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain for himself of for any other person, any gratification as a motive or reward for procuring the enrolment of any person, or leave of absence, promotion or any other advantage or indulgence for any person in the service; or  (f)  commits any offence against the property or person of any inhabitant of, or resident in, the country in which he is serving;  shall,on conviction by court-martial, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.

Intentionally.—A person is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences, of his act and the court may infer intention from the circumstances. See note 4 to AA.s.34.  5.  Clause (c). —(a) This offence is the same as the civil offence under IPC.s.309. (b)  A person should not be charged with attempted suicide unless the circumstances of the case make it clear that he seriously intended to take his life. (c) Where the action falls short of a deliberate intent to end his life, the accused could be charged under AA.s.46(c) or 63 (if appropriate); the charge alleging that the accused rendered himself temporarily unfit for duty by reason of his conduct.  (d)  At the summary of evidence and the trial evidence must be given by a medical officer as to the probable effect of the action which the accused took and he should also express his opinion as to the state of mind of the accused at the time of the commission of the alleged offence.  6.

(b)  Camp. —See note 13 to AA. s.34. \\'Cantonment\\' is not restricted to those stations which have been declared to be \"cantonments\" for the purposes of the Cantonments Act,1924 (II of 1924).

(c)  Without proper authority. —See note 3 (a) to AA. s.49.  7.  Clause (e). —(a) Gratification. —This term is not restricted to a pecuniary gratification or a gratification estimable in money. The offence is complete if the gratification is given with the intention indicated, and it is not necessary that the enrolment or other object should be actually procured. An attempt to obtain a gratification (e.g., by asking for it) is punishable equally with the actual receipt of one. An attempt to give a gratification (e.g., an offer of a bribe) is an abetment of the offence by way of instigation and is punishable under AA.s.66 or; 68 as the case may be.  (b)  Any other advantage or indulgence.—Such advantage etc., must be ejusdem generis.  8.  Clause (f). —(a) Offence. —For definition see AA.s.3(xvii). The word \"offence\" here means an offence which would be punishable, if committed in India as a civil offence.  (b)  See note 11 to AA.s.42.It is frequently of the highest importance to conciliate the inhabitants of the country where the troops happen to be, and to induce them to bring provisions and supplies. From this point of view an offence, which in other circumstances would be trivial, may require severe punishment, as for instance, if a trifling theft has the effect of disturbing the confidence of the inhabitants and endangering the supplies of the Army. A person should not be charged under this clause when the offence is committed in India. Elsewhere it is better that a charge should be preferred under AA.s.69 and not under this clause. The charge must set out the specific acts of violence or the specific offence alleged to have been done or committed.  65.  Attempt. — Any person subject to this Act who attempts to commit any of the offences specified in sections 34 to 64 inclusive and in such attempt does any act towards the commission of the offence shall, on conviction by court-martial, where no express provision is made by this Act for the punishment of such attempt, be liable, if the offence attempted to be committed is punishable with death, to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to fourteen years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned; and ',\n",

Does any act towards the commission of the offence: There is a difference between the preparation antecedent to an offence and the actual attempt. To constitute an attempt to commit an offence there must be an intent to commit the offence, a commencement of the commission and an act done towards the commission. An act is said to be done towards the commission of the offence when the offence remains incomplete only because something yet remained to be done, which the person intending to commit the offence is unable to do by reason of circumstances independent of his own volition. These words must not be construed to include all acts, however, remote, which tend towards the commission of the offence. The thing done may be too small or it may proceed too short a way towards the accomplishment of the offence for the law to notice it as an attempt. It must in every case be a question depending upon the circumstances whether a particular act done (with the requisite intention) towards the commission of the offence is sufficiently proximate to its commission to constitute an attempt or is so remote as to merely constitute preparation for its commission. 3.

'Civil offence' means an offence triable by a criminal court (AA.s.3(ii)). For definition of 'criminal court' See AA.s.3(viii). It therefore follows that a person subject of AA who while stationed in any country other than India commits an act or omission such is an offence under the civil law of that country but which if committed in India would not amount to a 'civil offence' cannot be charged under this section though a charge may properly be framed under AA.s.63 if the facts so warrant. 3.  'Subject to the provisions of AA.s.70'. —AA.s.70 prohibits trial by court-martial three civil offences viz., murder, culpable homicide not amounting to murder of a person not subject to military, naval or air force law e.g. a civilian or rape in relation for such a person, unless the said offence was committed: (a)  While on active service (for definition see AA.ss.3(i) and 9, or (b)  at any place outside India, or (c)  at a frontier post specified by the Central Govt, by notification in, this behalf.  1See IPC.s.53A. \",\n",

If the offence was committed at a place and in the conditions which permit of the offence being tried by court-martial; the court-martial may be held anywhere (AA.s.124) where courts-martial may be convened.  4.  Certain Acts of Parliament require that, before proceedings can be instituted in the criminal courts, the consent of the appropriate Govt. must be obtained (e.g., under s.13(3) of the Official Secrets Act,1923).It is not, however, necessary, before a person is charged with an offence under this section alleging that the civil offence is against such an Act, to obtain such a consent.  5.  For adjustment of jurisdiction between a criminal court and a court-martial when both have jurisdiction in respect of the same civil offence, see AA.s.125 and 126 and notes thereto. Also see AR 197A and Regs Army para 418.  6. See AA.s.139(6) and notes thereto, which enables a court-martial, when trying a person for a civil offence to find him not guilty of that offence but guilty of any other offence of which he might have been found guilty under the Cr. PC.  7. (a) For offences falling under clause (a), except only those offences for which an obligatory punishment is provided under the law in force in India (e.g. ,death or imprisonment for life for murder), a court-martial may award any of the following punishments: — (i)  Any punishment, other than whipping, assigned to the offence under the law in force in India; and (ii)  In addition to the above, one or more of the punishments specified in AA.s.71. (b)  For offences falling under clause (b),courts-martial may award: (i)  the punishment, other than whipping, assigned to the offence under the law in force in India, or (ii)  imprisonment which may extend to seven years, or (iii)  if the offender is under the rank of WO and the offence was committed on active service, field punishment up to 3 months, and (iv) in addition to any of the above one or more of the punishments specified in AA.s.71.

These should be treated as a guide only and it may be necessary to pass more severe sentence if, for example, the offence is committed on active service, or where attention has been called in local orders to the prevalence of the offence and such orders have been proved to the satisfaction of the court. 2.

       " 'In cases of charges under AA.s.69, a court-martial can also award any punishment, other than whipping, assigned for the offence under any law in force in India. For instance, a fine is not specified as a punishment in this section but a court-martial exercising jurisdiction under AA.s.69 can award a fine and such fine is recoverable under AA.ss.90(f), 91(h) or 174, if the civil offence in question is punishable with a fine under the law in force in India. 3.  As to jurisdiction and powers of GCM, SGCM, DCM and SCM, see AA.ss.118 to 120. 4 . As to disposal of property produced before a court-martial or regarding which an offence has been committed, see AA.ss.150 and 151. 5.  AA.s.73 specifics the particular instances in which more than one punishment may be awarded. 6.  Clause (a).—(a) A sentence of death can only be passed by a GCM with the concurrence of at least two-thirds of the members or by a SGCM with the concurrence of all the members; see AA.s.132(2)and(3).A certificate to the effect that the death sentence was passed with the concurrence of................ members /unanimously, as the case may be, should be endorsed in the proceedings. (b)  in awarding a sentence of death the court must add a direction that the accused shall suffer death by being hanged by the neck until he be dead;or by being shot to death; see AA.s.166. (c)  A person who is sentenced by a court martial to death continues to be subject to AA till the sentence is executed: see AA.s.123(4). (d)  Apart from AA.s.69, the offences where a sentence of death can be awarded are specified in AA.ss.34, 37 and 38(1). (e)  An officer sentenced to death or imprisonment must first be sentenced to be cashiered. AA.s.74. (f)  For forms of warrants, see Appx V to AR. 7. Clause (b).—(a) Imprisonment for life is a punishment which a GCM or SGCM can award only in cases of charges under AA.s.69 where such a punishment is assigned for that offence under the law in force in India or where the offence is punishable with death as under AA.s.34, 37 or 38(1) and the court considers that sentence to be too severe in the circumstances of the case. Imprisonment for life cannot be awarded for any of the remaining offences as the maximum punishment laid down for such offences is imprisonment for fourteen years or cashiering/dismissal. (b) For calculating fractions of terms of punishment imprisonment for life is to be reckoned as equivalent to imprisonment for twenty years (IPC.s.57),though for other purposes it is treated as imprisonment for the whole of the remaining period of the convicted man\\'s natural life. In practice, the sentence of imprisonment for life is treated as a sentence for a certain number of years only. (c)  In case of officers, a sentence of cashiering must precede sentence of imprisonment for life; see AA.s.74. (d)  Though a WO or NCO is deemed to be reduced to the ranks if sentenced to imprisonment for life, imprisonment, field punishment or dismissal from the service under AA.s.77, it is desirable to specify the reduction in the sentence. (e)  As to the date from which a sentence of imprisonment for life is to be reckoned, see AA.s.167. (g)  As to execution of sentences of imprisonment for life and forms of warrants see AA.ss.168, 170 and 172 and notes thereto. Form A and Form F in Part II of Appx. IV to the AR and Form J in Appx V to the said Rules. (h)  For suspension of a sentence of imprisonment for life or imprisonment see AA.ss.182 to 190 and notes thereto. 8. Clause (c).—(a) Imprisonment is either (i) rigorous, that is, with hard labour ; or (ii) simple. The terms \"rigorous\" and \"simple\" should invariably be used in sentences passed under AA. If a court inadvertently passes a sentence of \"imprisonment\" without specifying whether it is rigorous or simple, the sentence is treated as one of \"simple imprisonment\". Sentences of simple imprisonment are inexpedient and inconvenient of execution. 10—609 DMR&F(ND)/80  ',\n",

(c)  An officer sentenced to death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment must first be sentenced to be cashiered. (AA.s.74).

See Regs Army para 494(c).  (f)  For suspension of sentences see AA.ss.182 to 190 and notes thereto.  (g)  Sentences of imprisonment, unless for one or more years exactly, should, if for one month or upwards, be recorded in months. Sentences consisting partly of months and partly of days should be recorded in months and days. Also see Regs Army para 467(e).  9. Clause (d) and (e).—(a) Cashiering is the more ignominious form of dismissal; and normally an officer who has been cashiered cannot hold an appointment under the Government. (b)  In case of an officer, a sentence of cashiering must precede the sentence of death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment: AA.s.74.  (c)  For the date on which sentences of cashiering and dismissal take effect, see AR 168.  (d)  The decision whether a cashiered or dismissed officer shall receive a pension or gratuity, is in the discretion of the Government. Regs Pension Reg 16(a).  (e) Regs Army para 703(a) makes provision for the forfeiture of gallantry decorations, campaign and commemorative medals clasps in the event of a person subject to AA being cashiered or dismissed.  (f)  Dismissal under this section is a punishment awardable by a court-martial where as dismissal under AA.s.19 is an administrative measure.  10.  Clause (f). —(a) Service in the lower rank, grade or class will reckon from the date of signing the original sentence, whether the original sentence in question was a revised sentence or mitigated by the confirming officer from a more severe sentence.  (b)  Although the definition of NCO includes an acting NCO, a court-marital does not deal with acting or lance rank; a sentence reducing a Naik (acting Havildar) to Naik or Lance Naik, or a lance Naik to the ranks, is inoperative. See; Regs Army para 131 for definition of ranks and appointments.  (c)  Reduction of a WO or NCO under this section to the ranks or to a lower rank or grade is a punishment awardable by a court-martial whereas a similar reduction under A.A.s.20(4) is an administrative measure resorted to on grounds of inefficiency or unsuitability. See Regs Army paras 172 and 173.  (d)  The term \\'grade\\' means \\'rank\\'.  11.  Clause (g). —(a) For form of sentence see part I of Appendix III to AR. A sentence of forfeiture of seniority may be combined with a sentence of forfeiture if service for the purpose of promotion, (b)  Forfeiture of seniority of rank —The effect of a sentence of forfeiture of a seniority of rank is that the seniority of the person in his rank alone is affected, not the period of the service in the rank. For example, Capt \\'A\\', who is substantive Capt having been commissioned on 1 Jan 69, is awarded by a GCM on 1 Jun 78 forfeiture of 2 years seniority of rank. The sentence specifically reading as—\"to take rank and precedence as if his appointment as substantive Capt bore date the first day of Jan 1971\". As a result of this sentence Capt \\'A\\' would be Junior to all Captains commissioned before 1 Jan 71 in that rank. ',\n",

       " \"THE ARMY ACT, 1950 WITH NOTES  (c)  Forfeiture of service for the purpose of promotion. —This sentence can be awarded in respect of all or any part of his service. The forfeiture does not affect the seniority of the officer etc., in the rank he holds at the time the sentence is passed. The effect of this sentence would be that all future promotions depending upon length of service will be retarded by the period forfeited under this clause. This would not preclude a court-martial from awarding the punishment of forfeiture of seniority of rank in the form of sentencing an officer to take precedence in the rank held by him in his corps as if his name had appeared a specified number of places lower in the list of his corps, in cases where dates of appointment of a large number of officers are identical and the forfeiture of even one day's service for the purposes of promotion might in its effect constitute too severe a punishment for the offence which nevertheless would not be adequately met by a severe reprimand.  12. Clause (h).—(a) 'Prescribed' means prescribed by; rules made under AA, No other 'purpose' has so far been 'prescribed' under this clause.  (b)  As to forfeiture of service towards pension or gratuity on conviction for desertion or fraudulent enrolment, see Regs Pension, where the conditions under which service so forfeited is restored are also laid down.  13.  Clause (I): Severe reprimand or reprimand. —-(a) Although acting rank is not cognisable in the sentence of a court-martial, a sepoy holding any such rank, being a NCO (AA.s.3 (XV)), may nevertheless be sentenced by a court-martial to be severely reprimanded or reprimanded.  (b) Severe reprimand constitutes a 'red ink' entry; see Regs Army para 387(b).  14.  Clause (j). —(a) This punishment can only be awarded by a court-martial where an offence is committed on active service; for definition of 'active service', see AA.ss.3(i) and 9. It is immaterial where the trial takes place.  (b)  This sentence may be awarded in addition to other punishments. Care must be taken in awarding a sentence of forfeiture of pay and allowances in days to ensure that the total period in days does not exceed three calendar months e.g., when February intervenes.  (c)  The forfeiture commences from the date of award and applies to all pay and allowances but see AA.s.94. Any other stoppages of pay and allowances which the offender may be under are suspended during the period of the forfeiture.  15.  Clause (k). —As cashiering or dismissal takes effect from the date specified in AR168, this punishment will hardly be effective unless action has already been taken under AA.s.93 for withholding the pay and allowances of the accused in which case the pay and allowances so withheld will automatically be forfeited under AA.s.91(b) read with P and A Regs if the accused was in custody; forfeiture under this clause will then cover only arrears of pay and allowances prior to the date the accused was placed in custody as well as any public money due to him.  16.  Clause (l). —An award to compensate for loss or damage is termed 'stoppages'. Such an award can only be made if the particulars of the charge allege that the act or omission of the accused occasioned a loss or damage and, is proved on record (AR 30 (6)).  17.  Irrespective of the currency in which the wording of a charge may assess the loss or damage, any stoppage that is imposed by a court-martial must be awarded in the Indian currency. The only exception to this rule is where the accused's rate of pay is expressed in any Regulations/Instructions in any other currency.  18.  If a court wishes to award compensation to the injured party as well as to cause the offender to lose all arrears of pay and allowances, etc.. it should sentence him to stoppages under this clause and to forfeiture of all arrears of pay and allowances, etc. under clause (k). The stoppages will first be satisfied from any pay and allowances or other public money due to him, and the remainder (if any) will be forfeited to the State under the sentence.  19.  A court-martial acting under this clause will simply sentence the offender to stoppages to a certain extent. The recovery which is automatic will take place under the \",\n",

No portion of the pay and allowances of a person sentenced to dismissal is protected and the whole of such a person\\'s pay and allowances can, if necessary be withheld.  72.  Alternative punishments awardable by court-martial. — Subject to the provisions of this Act, a court-martial may, on convicting a person subject to this Act of the offences specified in sections 34 to 68 inclusive, award either the particular punishment with which the offence is stated in the said sections to be punishable, or, in lieu thereof, any one of the punishments lower in the scale set out in section 71, regard being had to the nature and degree of the offence.  NOTES 1. \"Subject to the provisions of this Act\"; AA.s.73 specifies the particular instances in which more than one punishment may be awarded. 2.  Field Punishment is deemed for the purpose of commutation to stand next below dismissal in the scale of punishments (AA.s.76) and may be awarded in lieu where permissible. 3. The punishments awardable by a court-martial on conviction for a civil offence under AA.s.69 are set out in that section.  73. Combination of punishments. — A sentence of a court-martial may award in addition to, or without any one other punishment the punishment specified in clause (d) or clause (e) of section 71 and any one or more of the punishments specified in clauses (f) to (1) of that section.  NOTES  1.  The following combined sentences are legal: —  (i)  Cashiering, imprisonment, stoppages and forfeiture of pay and allowances in the case of an officer.  (ii)  Imprisonment, dismissal, reduction (WO and NCO), stoppages and forfeiture.   (iii)  field punishment, dismissal, reduction (NCO) stoppages and forfeiture;  (iv)  forefeiture of seniority of rank, forfeiture of service for promotion (when applicable), severe reprimand, forfeitures and stoppages, in the case of an officer, JCOs, WO or NCO.  2.  It should be noted that field punishment and forfeiture of pay and allowances can only be awarded for an offence committed on active service. Further, a DCM cannot award a sentence of imprisonment to a WO (AA.s.119) nor can field punishment be awarded to an offender unless he is below the rank of WO.  3.  The punishments specified in this section may be awarded for civil offences tried under AA.s.69 either in lieu of, or in addition to, those assigned by the ordinary law to the offence of which the accused has been convicted.

       " 'NOTES 1.  (a)  AA.s.25 enjoins that the pay of any person subject to AA due to him as such under any regulation for the time being in force shall be paid without any deduction other than the deductions authorised by or under this or any other Act. The term \\'pay\\' means the rate of pay with increases, if any, for length of service, to which a person subject to AA is entitled by reason of his rank, appointment, trade group or trade classification, and includes additional remuneration such as qualification pay, proficiency pay and various forms of additional pay which is admissible only on fulfillment of certain conditions. Regulations may provide for the withdrawal of such additional remuneration if the conditions governing them, are not fulfilled. All other emoluments are \\'allowances\\'. Also see note 1 to AA. s.25. (b)  It is illegal to make deductions which are not authorised and the unlawful withholding of pay is an offence under AA.s.61.  2.  This section and AA.s.91 enunciate the penal deductions that may be made from the pay and allowances of an officer and a person other than an officer respectively and by implication exclude other penal deductions but they do not prohibit deductions not penal e.g., in respect of rations, or stoppages to meet a public claim or regimental debt or claim etc., under AR 205.  3.  Though this section and AA.s.91 are permissive, some of the penal deductions authorised thereunder have been made mandatory by P & A Regs (Officers) and OR Penal deductions under clauses (a), (d), (e) and (f) of this section have been made mandatory and those under clauses (b), (c), (g). (h) and (i) permissive; see para 528 of P & A Regs (Officers). 4.  As to remission of penal deductions, see AA.s.97 and AR 195. 5.  Clause (a). —If pay has been discontinued under P & A Regs or has not been drawn during a period of absence without leave, such pay is liable to be forfeited under this clause on the issue of an order by the Central Govt. If pay has been drawn during such a period, the issue constitutes an over-issue and the amount is recoverable as a public claim under AR205. It is unnecessary for an officer to be found guilty of absence by any tribunal before any deductions for the period of absence can be enforced under this clause.  6. Clause (b).—Pay and allowances are issuable to an officer though he is in custody or under suspension from duty on a charge for an offence unless such pay and allowances or any part thereof are directed to be with-held under AA.s.93, in which case they can be forfeited on his subsequent conviction for that offence. Even though pay and allowances are not so withheld, their issue during such period may constitute an over-issue and the amount may be recovered as a public claim under AR 205. 7.  Custody\\' includes custody by the civil authorities. 8. Suspension from duty.-See Regs Army para346,Valid deductions under this clause can only be made if the officer is subsequently convicted of the offence for which he was suspended or kept in custody.  9. Clause (c).—It is an offence under AA.s.61 to detain pay unlawfully, etc., but it would not appear necessary for an officer to be convicted of an offence under that section before a deduction may be mads under this clause.  10.  Clause \\'(d). —\\'Occasioned by\\'. In order to put an officer under stoppages by way of penal deductions, under either this clause or clause (g). it is not sufficient to show merely that the loss, etc., was facilitated or made possible by his offence, act, or neglect. It is necessary to show that the loss etc., was \"occasioned by\" in the sense of being the natural and reasonable consequence of the particular offence of which he is convicted. In the case, however, of the continuing wrongful act of improperly using Govt, property, e.g., a motor vehicle, any loss or damage happening to such property during the Continuance of such user may be held to be occasioned thereby. Where the loss etc, was merely facilitated or made possible by the offence, it is possible to effect its recovery as a public etc., claim under AR 205 where appropriate.  11. The term \\'expenses\\' and \\'losses\\' etc., In this clauses are not limited to public and regimental funds and property but would also extend to e.g. loss of wages and doctor\\'s      191  THE ARMY ACT, 1950 WITH NOTES  expenses incurred by an individual (servicemen or a civilian), as the direct result of the offence of which the delinquent is convicted. But occasion will rarely arise when it is advisable for a military tribunal to exercise its power of awarding a penal deduction to compensate a civilian, who has always his proper legal remedy of bringing a civil action for recovery of damages. Stoppages, however, should be awarded where a charge of theft of or damage to the property of a civilian is dealt with by court-martial or summarily. A person is not liable for the ordinary expenses of his prosecution, capture or conveyance or indirect expenses of a similar kind. Nor would he be liable under this clause for damage to a policeman\\'s clothes, because the policeman fell down and damaged them while in pursuit of the person endeavouring to escape. Where a person refuses to march, being able to do so, and a taxi has to be hired for his conveyance, he may be held liable for the expense thus incurred by his contumacy; but he would not be liable if intoxicated and incapable of walking. The principle is that stoppages are intended, not for punishment, but to compensate for the loss etc, sustained.  12.  Where an officer has been convicted for an offence by a Court-Martial which did not award any stoppages, no penal deductions can subsequently be ordered under this clause administratively for compensation for damage caused through that offence. 13.  As regards averment in the particulars of the charge of the amount of the loss etc., see AR 30(6). 14.  Clause (e). —Reference to AA.s.85 is wrong as it deals with a JCO; further stoppages have been covered under clause (d). A court-martial can award both forfeiture of pay and allowances or arrears thereof and stoppages under clauses (j), (k) and (1) of AA.s.71 respectively. However, an officer exercising authority under AA.s.83, 84 or 85 can award stoppages and not forfeiture. Therefore, pending statutory amendment this clause be read— \"All pay and allowances ordered by a court-martial to be forfeited\".  15.  Clause (f).—Fine is not one of the punishments specified in AA.s.71 and is only awardable by a court-martial when exercising jurisdiction under AA.s.69. 16.  When the fine awarded by court-martial cannot be recovered wholly by deductions from the pay and allowances of an officer, action may also be taken for its recovery under AA.s.174. 17 .Clause (g),—\\'Public property\\' in this clause means not only property of the Govt, but also any property belonging to the community at large as distinct from that which is private property. Captured enemy property becomes public property. 18.  The words \\'of public or regimental property\\' qualify \\'loss\\' and \\'damage\\' as well as destruction. Furniture etc., hired by the military authorities for military use may be treated as \"public\" or \"regimental\" property.  19. It must be shown to the satisfaction of the Central Govt, that there has been a loss etc., occasioned by (in the sense referred to in note 10 above) some wrongful act or negligence on the part of the officer; and as a general rule an officer is first afforded an opportunity of advancing any reasons why a deduction should not be made from his pay and allowances. The Central Govt, can legally impose a penal deduction on an officer under this clause notwithstanding that he has been previously dealt with under AA.s.83 or 84 or by a court-martial for the wrongful act or neglect but they may not increase a penal deduction awarded by court-martial or other authority, or order such deduction where the loss etc., was averted in the particulars but the court-martial or other authority did not award any stoppages. A mere invitation to an officer to make a payment towards any loss or damage occasioned by his wrongful act or neglect however, does not bar the Central Govt, from making an order under this clause. 20.  Negligence has the same meaning as \\'omission\\' or \\'neglect\\' in AA.s.63. see notes thereto. Also see Regs Army para 435. 21.  Clause (h).—(a) When there is reason to believe that an officer has been taken prisoner by his own voluntary action or wilful neglect of duty or that he has served with or under or has aided the enemy, etc., a provisional court of inquiry will be assem- ',\n",

The COA is or any officer authorised by him may then under AA.s.96 order the pay and allowances of such person to be withheld pending the result of such inquiry. A court of inquiry respecting a prisoner of war still absent and not known to have died in captivity will be provisional, to be followed later by another court of inquiry when the individual returns to service or is recovered. If the officer's conduct is found by the court of inquiry (provisional or otherwise) to be blameworthy, the Central Govt may, on the basis of such finding, order forfeiture of the pay and allowances of the officer. An officer, unlike a JCO, WO or OR does not automatically forfeit his pay and allowances while a prisoner of war.

In other words, if in a suit for maintenance or payment of alimony a civil court grants a decree in favour of the wife or children, the amount decreed can be deducted from the pay and allowance of a person and paid to the wife or children under this clause. Such being the intention, deductions should not, as a rule, be ordered under this clause or clause (i) of AA.s.91 except to give effect to a decree for maintenance granted by a civil court.

Clause (a).—It is unnecessary for a JCO, WO or OR to be found guilty of absence by a court-martial or by his CO before a forfeiture of pay and allowances for the period of absence can be enforced under this clause.   4.  A sepoy who has been sentenced by his CO to undergo detention or confinement to the lines under AAs.80 does not suffer deductions under this clause.  5.  A JCO, WO or OR automatically forfeits his pay and allowances while a prisoner of war and such pay and allowances cannot as a rule be restored to him unless a court of inquiry assembled to inquire into his conduct finds that he was not taken prisoner through neglect or misconduct on his part or that he was otherwise blameless and the authority prescribed in AR195(c) remits the forfeiture; see AA.ss.98 to 100 .ARs.178, 181 and 196 and Regs Army para 522.  6.  AA.s.92 prescribes how days of absence etc.,are to be calculated for the purposes of this clause and clause (b). For instance, if a person absented himself from 9 P.M.. on 1st Jun 78 and returned at 2.45 A.M. on 2nd Jun 78, he would forfeit no pay as his absence did not amount to six hours or upwards, but he was bound to go on guard or perform some other military duty and in consequence of his absence some other person had to go on guard or perform that duty, then he would forfeit one day's pay. Again, if a person absents himself at 10 P.M.. on the 1st Jun 78 and remains absent until 4 A.M., on the 2nd Jun 78, he would forfeit one day's pay, and if he remained absent until 2 A.M., on the 9th Jun 78, he would forfeit nine day's pay, for in the latter case he would be absent for over twelve consecutive hours and the period of absence on the 1st and 9th Jun would each reckon as absence for one whole day.  7.  When the sentence of imprisonment for life or imprisonment is suspended by competent authority under AA.s.182, no forfeiture under this clause can take place for the period it is so suspended.  8.  Clause (b).—See note 6toAA.s.90.

For persons below that rank \"close arrest\" is the same thing as \"confinement\" and they will forfeit pay and allowances for every day of \"close arrest\".

NCO or sepoy who has been sentenced to any punishment other than imprisonment or field punishment under AA.s.80 for the offence of absence without leave or a sepoy who is awarded imprisonment or field punishment under AA.s.80 for an offence other than that of absence without leave does not forfeit his pay and allowances while in custody under this clause.  10.  Upon a charge for desertion or absence without leave, a finding that the accused did the act charged but was insane at the time when he did the same, does not amount to a conviction, as it negatives \"intention\", and no forfeiture of pay and allowances results.

It, therefore, does not extend to sickness caused by immorality or intemperance, when there is no conviction (either by a court-martial or the officer disposing of the case summarily) for an offence by which the sickness was caused. The medical officer must attend the investigation of the offence, whether before the court-martial or the officer disposing of the case summarily, and give evidence in substantiation of the facts contained in his certificate.

In calculating the period of 30 days, the day on which the person became absent and the day on which the court of inquiry assembles must both be excluded.

The 'A-1' warrant is at present, issued by the COAS to officers Commanding Army, Corps, Division/Area and independent brigade and to officers prescribed by the Central Government under AA.s.8.  2. When a warrant has been issued and its contents communicated to the addresses, he can act upon it before it actually reaches him. It follows that he cannot act after he has received notification that the warrant has been revoked though he may not have received the actual order.  3. (a)  In granting a warrant, it should be clearly shown that during the absence of the officer to whom such warrant is issued, the powers therein conferred may be exercised by the officer on whom the command devolves, if he is not under a specified rank. It is, therefore, common to address such a warrant to an officer by designation of his office and not by name, (b)  If the officer on whom the command devolves is the CO of the person to be tried or an officer who has investigated the case, he cannot (except on board a ship or in such special cases as may be determined by the Central Government)afterwards act as convening officer in the same case, but must refer it to a superior authority. See Regs Army para 449(b).  4.  An officer cannot convene or confirm a court-martial held outside the territorial limits of his command; but an officer having power to convene a GCM at a port of embarkation can issue a warrant to the OC of the troops on board a ship empowering the latter to convene and confirm, on board the ship, during the period of the voyage, DCM in respect of a person under his command, who is subject to AA.

The object of this section is to provide for the speedy trial of offences committed abroad or on active service in cases where it is not practicable, with due regard to the interests of discipline and of the service, to try such offences by an ordinary GCM or DCM. A SGCM can try any offence committed on active service but when troops are not on active service it can only be convened by an officer empowered in this behalf by an order of the Central Government or of the COAS. 2.  The court can be convened by an officer commanding under clause (c) without a warrant or authorisation. For definition of 'regular Army': see AA.s.3(xxi).

The discipline of the regular Army depends in a great measure on the SCM. When a person amenable to AA has committed an offence which is ordinarily triable by SCM, a CO when determining by what court the accused is to be tried, must bear in mind that the legislature, in conferring upon him the power of a SCM, intends that he shall exercise those powers.  2.  Sub-secs(1) and (2).—(a) Though a SCM may, subject to the provisions of sub-sec (2), try an offence punishable, under AA, it is obvious that its powers of punishment are insufficient for many of the graver offences known to military law. COs should, therefore, notwithstanding the increased powers of summary trial vested in them, submit to higher authority any cases which appear to require more exemplary punishment than a SCM can award. It should, however, be remembered that even a comparatively slight punishment promptly inflicted is often more deterrent than a heavier one which follows long after the offence,  (b)  The CO is the best and sole judge, at the time, of the necessity which justified him in trying, without reference, cases which should ordinarily be tried only after reference and sanction. If it should subsequently appear to superior authority that his action was not justified, this should merely be viewed as a grave irregularity for which the CO may be held responsible but it does not affect the legality of the finding or sentence, nor, in ordinary circumstances, furnish reason for setting aside the trial, in whole or in part, Where, however, the officer holding the trial loses sight of the law, and tries without considering whether an emergency exists or not, the trial is illegal. See AR 130 for certificate to be attached to the proceedings by the officer holding the trial when he tries, without reference, a case which would ordinarily be referred to the officer empowered to convene a DCM or, on active service, a SGCM.  (c)  The offences which are not ordinarily triable by a SCM without reference and sanction are: offences punishable under AA.ss.34, 37 and 69 and offences against the officer holding the court.  (d)  Offence against the officer holding the trial.— It is difficult to lay down a definite rule in this matter, but, speaking generally, a consideration of personal interest which would suffice to disqualify an officer to sit as a member of a GCM or DCM debars him from holding a SCM (save in case of emergency) without previous reference. Offences under AA.ss.40 and 41 when committed towards a CO fall under this category, and should not, except in case of emergency, be tried by SCM without previous reference to the officer empowered to convene a DCM for on active service a SGCM) for the trial of the alleged  1See IPCs.53A.  \",\n",

Theft or misappropriation of property of which a CO is either part-owner or trustee (e.g.,mess or regimental property) should not, except as aforesaid, be tried by SCM without such reference. The reasons behind this restriction are: (i)  It is most undesirable that an offence against an individual should be tried by that individual, and the reason for immediate action would require to be unusually weighty to justify the provision as to reference to higher authority being disregarded when the offence is one against the officer holding the trial. (ii)  At a trial by SCM the officer holding the trial cannot himself give evidence against an accused person appearing before him, except evidence of a formal character such as the production of document. But see AR 123 which authorises the court to record \"of its own knowledge\" certain facts for guidance in determining the sentence. If he gives formal evidence, he must be sworn/affirmed as a witness. Where it is necessary for the CO of the accused to give material evidence for the prosecution, he should apply for a DCM so as to secure an impartial trial.  3.  Sub-sec (3).—A SCM can only try a NCO or a sepoy.  4.  Under the command of the officer holding the court—An officer holding the court, i.e., the CO of a unit cannot try a NCO or a sepoy by SCM unless such person is under his command, e.g., belongs to that unit on the date of trial. The only two exceptions to this rule are, in the case of trial of deserters or absentees without leave and in cases where such a person is a patient in a hospital Regs Army Para 381 and 443 refer.  5.  A NCO or a sepoy cannot be attached to another unit for the purpose of his trial by SCM except as provided in Regs Army para 381.  6.  Sub-secs (4) and (5). —The maximum punishment awardable by a SCM is imprisonment for one year if the officer holding the court is of the rank of Lt Col and above and for three months if such an officer is below that rank.  7.  As to the principles to be observed by a SCM in awarding sentence, see notes to AA. s.169 and Regs Army para 448.  121.  Prohibition of second trial. —- When any person subject to this Act has been acquitted or convicted of an offence by a court-martial or by a criminal court, or has been dealt with under any of the sections 80, 83, 84 and 85, he shall not be liable to be tried again for the same offence by a court-martial or dealt with under the said sections.

Finding of a GCM, SGCM or DCM, if not confirmed, is of no validity, in such case, therefore, the accused has not been acquitted or convicted, and may legally be tried again; see AA.s.153; but re-trials should rarely be resorted to, and only when the needs of discipline and justice demand that an offender shall not escape punishment on account of a legal technicality. Re-trial should not be ordered until the DJAG of the command has been consulted and the sanction of superior authority obtained. 2. Where a court is not legally constituted and has no jurisdiction-as for example, if the convening order is signed by or on behalf of an officer not authorised to convene such a court, or if the number of officers composing the court is below the legal minimum required for that type of court, or if unqualified officers sit—it is no court at all. The accused will not have been really tried, and may be tried again, even though the proceedings of such illegally constituted court have been inadvertently confirmed.

Thus, on a charge of desertion, a person could by virtue of AA.s.139(1) be convicted of absence without leave: if he is acquitted generally, the acquittal applies to both offences, and he cannot subsequently be charged with absence (upon the same facts); if, however, the court while acquitting him of desertion; convicts him of absence, and this finding is not confirmed, he has not been acquitted of absence, and can be charged again with that offence. 4.  Where a person is re-tried on the same charge, it is not usual to impose a more severe punishment than that awarded on the first trial, and a confirming officer should exercise his powers of mitigation, etc.. when confirming the proceedings, if a greater punishment has been awarded on the second trial. 5.  Where a new trial is ordered, no officer may serve on it who sat on the former court; AR 39(2)(c). 6.  The section merely prohibits a second trial by court-martial or being dealt with again under AA.ss.80, 83, 84 and 85 but the civil law remains supreme and a person acquitted or convicted by a court-martial or dealt with under AA. ss.80, 83, 84 or 85 can be tried again by a criminal court for the same offence or on the same facts; see AA.s.127 and notes. 7.  See ARs 53(1) and 114, which provide that a plea in bar of trial may be raise on this ground.  122. Period of limitation for trial.—  (1) Except as provided by sub-section (2), no trial by court-martial of any person subject to this Act for any offence shall be commenced after the expiration of a period of three years [and such period shall commence.- (a)  on the date of the offence; or (b)  where the commission of the offence was not known to the person aggrieved by the offence or to the authority competent to initiate action, the first day on which such offence comes to knowledge of such person or authority, whichever is earlier; or (c)  where it is not known by whom the offence was committed, the first day on which the identity of the offender is known to the person aggrieved by the offence or to the authority competent to initiate action, whichever is earlier.]1 (2) The provisions of sub-section (1) shall not apply to a trial for an offence of desertion or fraudulent enrolment or for any of the offences mentioned in sec-37. (3)  In the computation of the period of time mentioned in sub-section (1), time spent by such person as a prisoner of war, or in enemy territory, or in adding arrest after the commission of the offence, shall be excluded. (4)  No trial for an offence of desertion other than desertion on active service or of fraudulent enrolment shall be commenced if the person in question, not being an officer, has subsequently to the commission of the offence, served continuously in an exemplary manner for not less than three years with any portion of the regular Army.  NOTES 1.  Sub-sec (1) and (2). —(a) The effect of this section is that on the expiration of three years from the commission of the offence — the period of three years to be computed in accordance with sub-sec (3) — the offender is free from being tried or punished under AA by a Court-martial for any offence except those mentioned in AA.s.37. desertion or fraudulent enrolment. It follows that where an accused person is charged with desertion commencing on a date more than three years before his trial begins, he cannot be found guilty under AA.s.139(1) of absence without leave from that date, but such absence must, be restricted to a period not exceeding three years immediately prior to the commencement of the trial. Where, however, such a finding and sentence has been wrongly confirmed, the authorities specified in AA.s.163 may substitute a valid finding and pass a sentence for the offence specified or involved in such finding. (b) A plea in bar of trial may be raised on this ground: AR 53(1)(c).  1Subsituted vide Act 37 of 1992 w.e.f. 6-9-1992 ',\n",

       " \"2.  The section, does not prohibit deductions being ordered from his pay and allowances under AA.s.90(a),(c), (g) and (h) or 91(a), (f) and (g) even though the period of limitation for trial has expired. Though the section specifically stipulates the period of limitation for trial by court-martial,the same principle would equally apply to summary disposal of offences under AA.s.80, 83, 84 or 85. 3.  (a) Offences mentioned in AA.s.37 and desertion on active service can be tried at any time by a Court-Martial. For desertion not on active service and fraudulent enrolment, a person, not being an officer, cannot be tried if he has since served continuously in an exemplary manner for not less than three years with any portion of the regular Army. See sub-sec (4). (b) A person is considered as having served in an exemplary manner if at any time during his service subsequent to the commission of the offence he has had no red ink entry in his conduct sheet for a continuous period of three years (Regs Army para 465). For 'red ink entries' see Regs Army paras 386 and 387(b). 4. (a) An 'offence' includes a 'civil offence' as defined in AA.s.3(ii); see AA.s.3(xvii).Where, therefore, a person subject to AA has committed a civil offence and his trial by court-martial is barred under this section, he may be handed over to the civil authorities to be dealt with according to law as a civil offence is triable by a criminal court at any time. 5.  For forfeiture of service in the case of desertion and fraudulent enrolment, see Regs Pension Reg 123. 6.  Sub-sec (3): The period of three years referred to in sub-sec (1) is extended by any time spent by the offender as a prisoner of war, or in enemy territory or in evading arrest after the commission of the offence; for instance, if a person absconds immediately after misappropriating Govt or regimental funds and later surrenders or is apprehended after the expiry of three years, he can still be tried by a court-martial, the period during which he had absconded being ignored. 7.  'Enemy territory' means any area, at the time of the presence therein of the person in question, under the sovereignty of or administered by or in the occupation of a state at that time at war with the Union. 8.  Sub-sec (4). —'On active service', see AA.ss.3(i) and 9. 9. See note 3(b) above. This exemption does not apply to an officer. 10.  'Regular Army' see AA.s.3(xxi).  123.  Liability of offender who ceases to be subject to Act. — (1) Where an offence under this Act had been committed by any person while subject to this Act, and he has ceased to be so subject, he may be taken into and kept in military custody, and tried and punished for such offence as if he continued to be so subject.  (2) No such person shall be tried for an offence, unless his trial commences 2[within a period of three years after he had ceased to be subject to this Act; and in computing such period , the time during which such person has avoided arrest by absconding or concealing himself or where the institution of the proceeding in respect of the offence has been stayed by an injuction or order , the period of the continuance of the injuction or order, the day on which it was issued or made, and the on which it was withdrawn , shall be excluded.]  Provided that nothing contained in this sub-section shall apply to the trial of any such person for an offence of desertion or fraudulent enrolment or for any of the offences mentioned in section 37 or shall affect the jurisdiction of a criminal court to try any offence triable by such court as well as by a court-martial. (3)  When a person subject to this Act is sentenced by a court-martial to (imprisonment for life)1 or imprisonment, this Act shall apply to him during the term of his sentence, though he is cashiered or dismissed from the regular Army, or has otherwise ceased to be subject to this Act, and he may be kept, removed, imprisoned and punished as if he continued to be subject to this Act. (4)  When a person subject to this Act is sentenced by a court-martial to death, this Act shall apply to him till the sentence is carried out.  1See IPC-s.53A. 2Substituted vide Act 37 of 1992 w.e.f. 6-9-1992 \",\n",

       " \"NOTES 1.  This section meets the case of a person who commits an offence against AA whilst subject to it, and then ceases to be subject to it. Such cases will occur; for example, when an officer relinquishes his commission or is dismissed or when a JCO, WO or OR is discharged. 2.  (a) Such a person though he has ceased to be subject to AA even before discovery of the offence may nevertheless be arrested, tried and punished just as if he were still so subject but he can only be tried within six months after he has ceased to be so subject; the six months will not be deemed to have expired if the trial has commenced within that period. An exception has been made in the case of desertion, fraudulent enrolment and offences mentioned in AA.s.37, for which he can be tried at any time subject to the restrictions in AA.s.122, Further, a criminal court can try such offence, if triable by it as well as a court-martial, though the offence is no longer triable by a court-martial under sub-sec. (2). (b)  When the six months have once expired, the offender is protected and his liability is not revived in respect of the earlier offence, by his again becoming subject to AA. 3.  Sub-Sec (3). —Under this sub-sec, which deals with the case of a person subject to AA who is tried and sentenced to imprisonment for life or imprisonment to be undergone in a civil prison, AA applies to such a person during the term of his sentence, not withstanding that his cashiering or dismissal from the service has been formally carried out, or that he has otherwise ceased to be subject to AA. Consequently he may be tried by court-martial for an offence committed by him while under sentence at any time before his sentence is completed or he may be kept in or removed to military custody and made to undergo his sentence there although the sentence is one to be undergone in a civil jail. Also see AR 168.  124.  Place of trial.- Any person subject to this Act who commits any offence against it may be tried and punished for such offence in any place whatever.  NOTES 1.  Any place whatever means any place in which the offender may for the time being be and which is within the jurisdiction of an officer authorised to convene a court-martial for his trial as if the offence had been committed where the trial takes place and the offender were under the command of the officer convening such court. 2.  The section enables a court-martial convened in India to try a person for an offence committed elsewhere and vice versa. See Regs Army para 452(c).  125. Choice between criminal court and court-martial.- When a criminal court and a court-martial have each jurisdiction in respect of an offence, it shall be in the discretion of the officer commanding the army, army corps, division or independent brigade in which the accused person is serving or such other officer as may be prescribed to decide before which court the proceedings shall be instituted, and if that officer decides that they should be instituted before a court martial, to direct that the accused person shall be detained in military custody.  NOTES 1.  (a) for definitions of 'criminal court' and 'court-martial' see AA.s.3(viii) and (vii) respectively. (b)  All civil offences can be tried by a court-martial (subject to the provisions of AA.s.70) or by a criminal court. See also Regs Army para 419 (a). (c)  Where there is a dual jurisdiction as indicated above, the choice initially lies with the military officers mentioned in this section to decide whether an accused should be dealt with by a court-martial or he should be handed over to the civil authorities for being dealt with according to civil law. (d)  The 'prescribed officer' for the purpose of this section is the officer commanding the brigade or station in which the accused person is serving, except where death has resulted from the alleged offence, in which case the lowest competent military authority is the officer. commanding a division/area or independent brigade.

(a) Where a criminal court having jurisdiction considers that the accused should be tried before itself, it may, in writing, call upon the officer referred to in this section to hand over the accused to it for trial, in which case the said officer should either hand over the accused as demanded or pend the proceedings and refer the case to the Central Govt (AA.s.126).  (b)  When a person subject to AA is brought before a magistrate and charged with an offence for which he is liable to be tried by a court-martial, such magistrate, unless he is moved by the competent military officer referred to in AA.s.125 to proceed against the accused under the Cr PC, 1973, shall before so proceeding give written notice to the CO of the accused and, until the expiry of fifteen days from the date of service of such notice, shall not proceed to try such person or to inquire with a view to his commitment for trial by the court of sessions for any offence triable by such court; see Govt of India Ministry of Home Affairs notification SO 488 dated 9 Feb 1978, the criminal courts and court-martial (Adjustment of jurisdiction) Rules, 1978 and Regs Army para 418,  3.  An offender is normally handed over to the civil authorities for trial where he is alleged to have committed an offence in collaboration with other persons who are not subject to military law.  126.  Power of criminal court to require delivery of offender. — (1) When a criminal court having jurisdiction is of opinion that proceedings shall be instituted before itself in respect of any alleged offence, it may, by written notice, require the officer referred to in section 125 at his option, either to deliver over the offender to the nearest magistrate to be proceeded against according to law, or to postpone proceedings pending a reference to the Central Government.  (2)  In every such case the said officer shall either deliver over the offender in compliance with the requisition, or shall forthwith refer the question as to the court before which the proceedings are to be instituted for the determination of the Central Government, whose order upon such reference shall be final.

Commissions for examination of witnesses.- (1) Whenever, in the course of a trial by court-martial, it appears to the court that the examination of a witness is necessary for the ends of justice, and that the attendance of such witness cannot be procured without an amount of delay, expense or inconvenience which, in the circumstances of the case, would be unreasonable, such court may address the Judge Advocate General in order that a commission to take the evidence of such witness may be issued. (2)  The Judge Advocate General may then, if he thinks necessary, issue commission to any district magistrate or magistrate of the first class, within local limits of whose jurisdiction such witness resides to take the evidence of such witness. (3)  The magistrate or officer to whom the commission is issued, or if he is the district magistrate, he or such magistrate of the first class as he appoints in this behalf, shall proceed to the place where the witness is or shall summon the witness before him and shall take down his evidence in the same manner and may for this purpose exercise the same powers, as in trials of warrant cases under the 2[Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 (2 of 1974)]or any corresponding law in force in (the State of Jammu and Kashmir)1.

This section and the next provide for the examination of witness \"on commission\", that is, by means of a series of written questions decided upon by the court trying the case, which questions are sent to another court at a distance and put by it to the witness, whose answers are then recorded. It will be noticed that the procedure here laid down can only be set in motion by a court-martial assembled for the trial of the accused, and then only in the circumstances specified in sub-sec (1), while the actual issue of the commission can only be effected by the JAG or the DJAG. When a court-martial considers that the evidence of a witness should be taken on commission it should forward to the DJAG of the command (or to the JAG if the trial is not held in command or is held in a command in which there is not a DJAG) a list of questions to be put to the witness, along with an explanation of the circumstances which appear to render his examination on commission necessary. Any questions which the prosecutor or the accused desire to have put to the witness, and which the court considers relevant, should be added. 2.  The taking of evidence by commission in courts-martial should be most sparingly resorted to, and ought not to be adopted save in extreme cases of delay, expense or in convenience. The following considerations should guide courts-martial in this important matter:  (a)  A complainant, or a witness who practically fills the role of complainant, should never be examined on a commission; the risk of injustice to the accused is too great. (b)  A material prosecution witness, the value of whose evidence can only be made apparent under full examination and cross-examination in court should very seldom be so examined. (c)  A merely \"formal\" or corroborative witness for either side, or a material witness for the defence, if the accused is fully satisfied by this action, might generally be examined on a commission. By \"formal\" is here meant a witness who has to prove a document, entry, or similar fact, which must be legally proved, but which when so proved cannot rationally be disputed by the accused or by the prosecution.  138. Examination of a witness on commission. — (1) The prosecutor and the accused person in any case in which a commission is issued under section 137 may respectively forward any interrogatories in writing which the court may think relevant to the issue, and the magistrate or officer executing the commission shall examine the witness upon such interrogatories,  (2)  The prosecutor and the accused person may appear before such magistrate or officer by counsel or, except in the case of an accused person in custody, in person, and may examine cross-examine and re-examine as the case may be,the said witness.  (3)  After a commission issued under section 137 has been duly executed, it shall be returned, together with the deposition of the witness examined there under to the Judge Advocate General.  (4)  On receipt of a, commission and deposition returned under sub-section (3) the Judge Advocate General shall forward the same to the Court at whose instance the commission was issued, or if such court has been dissolved, to any other court convened for the trial of the accused person; and the commission, the return there to and the deposition shall be open to inspection by the prosecutor and the accused person, and may, subject to all just exceptions, be read in evidence in the case by either the prosecutor or the accused, and shall from part of the proceedings of the court.  (5)  In Every case in which a commission is issued under section 137, the trial may be adjourned for a specified time reasonably sufficient for the execution and return of the commission.     220  THE ARMY ACT, 1950 WITH NOTES  NOTES 1.  See notes to AA.s.137. 2.  Evidence taken on commission at the instance of a court-martial which has been dissolved is admissible before another court-martial assembled for the trial of the accused (of course, only on the same or substantially the same charges). If great delay in the return of a commission is anticipated, advantage may be taken of this provision and the original court dissolved. In such a case, however, each of the witnesses who gave evidence at the first trial must repeat this evidence on oath or affirmation at the second trial unless— (a)  he is dead or cannot be found; or (b)  he is incapable of giving evidence; or (c)  he is kept out of the way by the adverse party; or (d)  his presence cannot be obtained without an amount of delay or expense which, under the circumstances of the case, the court considers unreasonable. In any of these cases the evidence given at the first trial can, under IEA.s.33, be read and considered at the second trial.  139. Conviction of offence not charged. —(1)  A person charged before a court-martial with desertion may be found guilty of attempting to desert or of being absent without leave.  (2) A person charged before a court-martial with attempting to desert may found guilty of being absent without leave.  (3) A person charged before a court-martial with using criminal force may be found guilty of assault.  (4) A person charged before a court-martial with using threatening language may be found guilty of using insubordinate language.  (5)  A person charged before a court-martial with any one of the offences specified in clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d) of section 52 may be found guilty of any other of these offences with which he might have been charged.  (6)  A person charged before a court-martial with an offence punishable under section 69 may be found guilty of any other offence of which he might have been found guilty if the provisions of the [Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974),]1 were applicable.  (7) A person charged before a court-martial with any offence under this Act, may, on failure of proof of an offence having been committed in circumstances involving a more severe punishment, be found guilty of the same offence as having been committed in circumstances involving a less severe punishment.  (8)  A person charged before a court-martial with any offence under this Act may be found guilty of having attempted or abetted the commission of that offence, although the attempt or abetment is not separately charged.

A Court may, however, (as allowed by AR 62(5)) find a person guilty of a charge with the exception of certain words in the particulars of the charge or with certain immaterial variations, and this finding will be valid as long as in its reduced or varied form it discloses the offence which forms the subject of the charge. 2.  Alternative charges should not be preferred in the cases provided for in this section but in other cases where the facts disclose a greater and a lesser offence it may in practice be expedient\" to prefer alternative charges, the more serious offence being placed first in order (see note to AR 52(3)). 3.  This section does not permit a court-martial to find an accused guilty of one or other of two offences e.g., a finding of \"not guilty of theft but guilty of dishonest misappropriation or criminal breach of trust.\" 4.

(a)  This section provides for the admissibility in evidence of a variety of documents or copies of documents used in connection with military administration but does not make them conclusive proof of the facts stated in them; therefore evidence may be given to contradict them. (b)  The documents made admissible in evidence by this section can only be received as such when produced by a witness on oath or affirmation. (c)  A document purporting to be such a document as a specified in the various sees is upon mere production on oath or affirmation to the court prima facie evidence of the facts there in stated, but, of course, it is not evidence that the accused is the person to whom it relates; and evidence must be given on oath or affirmation by a witness to prove that the accused is in fact the person referred to in the document, \\'it the accused disputes the. identity, great caution is required as to the sufficiency of the evidence and he disputes the accuracy or completeness of the books, further evidence. on the disputed points must be adduced. 3.  Purporting -This expression that if the paper appears to be certified or signed as mentioned in the sub-sec, it can be accepted without calling a witness to prove that it has been so certified, signed, etc.. unless indeed some evidence is given to the contrary If any evidence is given casting a doubt on the authenticity of a document, the court should require evidence of the certificate or signature, etc., to be given by a witness. 4.  Sub-sec (1) -(a) This sub-sec is limited to proof of the fact of length of service or date of dismissal or discharge: it does not assist proof of particular incidents occurring during such service A telegram, as delivered by the telegraph department, respecting the service of a person is not signed at all and would not be admissible.

It should be noted that every entry in a regimental book is not made evidence under this sub-sec: the entry must be made for the purpose of being used as a record must be made in pursuance of AA or of any rules made thereunder or in pursuance of military duty, and it must purport to be signed by the CO or by the officer whose duty it is to make the record. No hard and fast rules can be laid down as to what entires can properly be considered as \"records\", but as a general rule this sub-sec should only be taken advantage of in cases, where a formal record, prima facie of non-controversial character is made in a regimental book of record in pursuance of AA, the AR or of military duty and purporting to be signed in accordance with this sub-sec. Entries which cannot properly be considered as records, such as daily entries in accounts, and entries in books not being \"regimental books\", such as books of a brigade or station office and company order books can, of course, be proved under the ordinary provisions of the Indian Evidence Act.  1 Inserted Vide Act 37 of 1992 w.e.f. 6-9-1992      ',\n",

Sub-sec(4).—Such a copy cannot be certified by another officer \"for\" the officer having the custody of the book.  10.  Where a certified true copy of a record in any \"regimental book\" is to be produced, the copy should show clearly that the record purports to have been signed by the CO or by the officer whose duty it was to make the record.  11.  Where IAFD-918 is to be produced, it must be signed by the officer having the custody of the books from which it is compiled. The original declaration of the court of inquiry even if in existence, is not admissible in evidence.

If the deserter or absentee surrenders to or is apprehended by any officer, the certificate must purport to be signed by that officer. But if the offender surrenders himself to a JCO, WO, NCO or Sepoy of any unit, department or detachment, or if the offender is apprehended by a JCO, WO, NCO, or sepoy, the certificate must purport to be signed by the CO of such JCO etc., of that unit, department or detachment.  14 .The certificate must purport to be signed by the officer indicated and not by another officer \\'for\\' him.  15.

(ii)  In cases where guilty knowledge or intention or design is of the essence of the offence, proof may be given that the accused did other acts similar to those which form the basis of the charge; such evidence is admissible not to show that because he has committed one offence, he would, therefore, be likely to commit another offence of the same nature but to prove intention, knowledge, good faith etc., of the  accused with regard to the act or to rebut (even by anticipation) the defence of accident, mistake etc, and to show that the offence charged formed part of a series of similar occurrence IEA.ss.14 and 15.  \",\n",

As to insanity in connection with responsibility for crime, see IPC.s.84, which lays down the legal test of responsibility in cases of alleged unsoundness of mind. 2.  It is to be observed that two distinct cases are contemplated. A person may have been sane at the time when he did act or made the omission charged, but may not be sane enough to make his defence; while on the other hand, a person insane at the time when he did the act or made the omission charged may have recovered sufficiently to take his trial. In the case of a court-martial whose finding requires confirmation, confirmation is required in both the cases mentioned above. 3.  An application that the accused is of unsound mind and consequently incapable of making his defence should be made before arraignment. The application will normally be made by counsel for the defence or the defending officer, but should, if necessary, be made by the prosecutor. Evidence in support of the application may of course, be given. 4.  Where a court-martial finds that an accused person committed the act (or made the omission) alleged as constituting the offence (or offences) specified in the charge or charges but was by reason or unsound ness of mind incapable of knowing the nature of the act or that it was wrong or contrary to law, such finding does not amount to a conviction, but means that on the facts proved the court would have found him, guilty of the offence (offences) had it not been established to its satisfaction that the accused at the time was not responsible for his actions.

Finding and sentence not valid, unless confirmed. — No finding or sentence of a general, district or summary general, court-martial shall be valid except so far as it may be confirmed as provided by this Act.  NOTES  1.  (a)For details as regards the authorities/officers empowered to confirm findings and sentences of courts-martial see AA.ss.154 to 157 and notes thereto. (b)  The finding(s) and sentence of a SCM do not require confirmation: AA.s.161.  2.  (a)  Confirmation is complete when the proceedings are promulgated. (SeeAR.71). At any time before promulgation the confirming authority may cancel his minute of confirmation and revoke the minute or order a revision. If proceedings are confirmed in error by an officer not having power to confirm, his act and the subsequent promulgation are null, and it is open to the proper authority to confirm. (b)  A CO who has investigated the case cannot subsequently confirm the proceedings of a court-martial arising out of the same matter. Regs Army para 471. (c) Similarly a member of a court-martial or an officer who has acted as prosecutor cannot confirm the proceedings of that court-martial. AR 74.  3. (a)  The result of this section is that if a finding of \\'guilty\\' or \\'not guilty\\' is not confirmed it is invalid; consequently there is no conviction or acquittal, and the accused has not been convicted or acquitted by a court-martial for the purpose either of any subsequent trial or of any entry in regimental books or of any forfeiture. See AA.s.121 and notes as to a second trial, and AR 149 as to merely technical errors not involving injustice to the accused. (b)  Confirmation of the sentence alone implies confirmation of the finding also, but is not the correct mode of recording confirmation.  4.  Confirmation ought to be withheld in the following cases: —  (a)  Where the provisions of AA relating to jurisdiction have been contravened. See AA.s.109 to 115, 118 and 119 and 128 to 132.  (b)  Where evidence of a nature prejudicial to the accused has been wrongly admitted.  (c)  Where the accused has been unduly restricted in his defence.  (d) Where a finding of \\'guilty\\' has been come to with the exception of certain words of the charge, and these words so far describe the essence of the offence, that the finding with the words omitted fails to disclose an offence of which the court could legally have convicted.  (e)  Where a special finding of \\'guilty\\' fails to disclose an offence of which the court could have legally convicted.  (f)  Where the charge is bad in law, even though the accused has pleaded guilty. (g) Where there has been such a deviation from the ARs that injustice has been done to the accused.  5. A confirming officer cannot substitute a special finding on any charge for the court\\'s finding; he can only confirm, reserve confirmation for superior authority, send back for revision, or refuse to confirm.

       " 'NOTES 1. As to mitigation of sentence for offences in several charges, where the finding on one or more of them is not confirmed, see AR 72; and as to the power of the confirming officer to vary a sentence informally expressed or in excess of the punishment authorized by law, see AR 73. 2.  The powers conferred by this section may be exercised by the confirming officer, as such, only when confirming the sentence. After promulgation, when the confirmation is complete the power of the confirming officer in that capacity ceases and the above powers can only be exercised by one of the authorities mentioned in AA.s.179. 3.  A confirming officer may also, under AA.s.183 direct that an offender sentenced to imprisonment for life or imprisonment be not committed until the orders of the authority/officer specified in AA.s.182 are obtained. If himself an authority under AA.s.182 he has further powers as such under that section. 4.  \\'Mitigation\\' is awarding a less amount of the same species of punishment,as, for example, by reducing the length of imprisonment to which an offender has been sentenced; and is in effect equivalent to a remission of part of the sentence. The power to mitigate etc, cannot be exercised whilst execution of the sentence is suspended. 5. \\' Remission\\' may be remission of the whole or of part of the sentence; thus a sentence of imprisonment may be remitted altogether, or a portion of the term may be remitted. A confirming officer cannot remit such forfeiture of pay and allowances, as follow automatically (under AA.ss.90 and 91 and P and A Regs) upon the finding of the court. 6.  (a) \\'Commutation\\' is changing the description of punishment by awarding a punishment lower in the scale of punishments in AA.s.71, as imprisonment in lieu of imprisonment for life, or dismissal in lieu of cashiering, or forfeiture of seniority in lieu of reduction in rank.  (b)  \\'Other punishments\\'. —There is no standard of comparison between one punishment and two or more other punishments, and as it is necessary that the commuted sentence should be less than the original sentence, commutation of one punishment to two or more punishments is only permissible where it is obvious that the two are together less severe than the one, e.g., death commuted to cashiering and imprisonment for life or dismissal to forfeiture of seniority and severe reprimand. Partial commutation of any one punishment by the substitution for a portion thereof of another punishment is illegal; thus where in a case of \"losing by neglect\" a court passed a sentence of imprisonment, but omitted to pass a sentence of stoppages of pay which would have been valid, a portion of the imprisonment cannot be commuted to stoppages.  (e)  If a confirming officer purports (by way of commutation) to substitute for a valid sentence a sentence which the court had no power to award, neither the original sentence since it has been commuted—nor the new sentence—since it is illegal—can stand. That conviction, however, remains good. 7.  Where a term of imprisonment or field punishment is reduced in length by remission or mitigation, automatic forfeiture of pay under AA.s.91 and P&A Regs is governed by the term actually undergone—not by that originally imposed. So, too, pay and allowances are not automatically forfeited, whilst a sentence is suspended.  159.  Confirming of findings and sentences on board a ship. — When any person subject to this Act is tried and sentenced by a court-martial while on board a ship, the finding and sentence so far as not confirmed and executed on board the ship, may be confirmed and executed in like manner as if such person had been tried at the port of disembarkation.

Execution of sentence of imprisonment in special cases.—Whenever, in the opinion of an officer commanding an army, army corps, division or independent brigade, any sentence or portion of a sentence of imprisonment cannot for special reasons, conveniently be carried out in a military prison or in military custody in accordance with the provisions of section 169 such officer may direct that such sentence or portion of sentence shall be carried out by confinement in any civil prison or other fit place.  NOTES  1.  'Army, Army corps, division': See SRO 135A dated 22 Jul 50 (Part (IV)). 2.  The power conferred in this section might be of use in an emergency, such as an epidemic. It will also admit of local arrangements being made for the execution of a sentence of rigorous imprisonment passed in any place outside India when it is, for any reason, inconvenient or undesirable that an offender should be sent to India to undergo his sentence. In such a case, the warrant of commitment in Form B (see Part II of Appendix IV to AR) must be suitably varied (see AR 4) and must cite the order made under this section. When the prisoner is to be despatched to India he should be demanded by a warrant in Form G in the said Appendix and must be committed to the civil prison in India on a fresh warrant of commitment. 3.  This section differs from AA.s.169(4) in that (a) the direction may be made by the specified authorities even though the troops are not on active service and (b) the direction can be made only when the imprisonment is to be carried out in a military prison or military custody.  172.  Conveyance of prisoner from place to place.— A person under sentence of (imprisonment for life)1 or imprisonment may during his conveyance from place to place, or when on board ship, aircraft, or otherwise, be subjected to such restraint as is necessary for his safe conduct and removal.  173.  Communications of certain orders to prison officers. — Whenever an order is duly made under this Act setting aside or varying any sentence, order or warrant under which any person is confined in a civil or military prison, a warrant in accordance with such order shall be forwarded by the officer making the order or his staff officer or such other person as may be prescribed to the officer in charge of the prison in which such person is confined.  \",\n",
       " 'NOTES 1.  For form of warrants under this section, see Forms D to G in Part II of Appendix IV to the AR. The heading of each of these shows clearly the cases in which it is to be used. It will be noticed that Form D is applicable to cases in which the person concerned is to be released, Form E to those in which he remains in a civil prison and Form F to those in which he remains in a civil or military prison but with a reduced sentence, and Form G to those in which he is to be transferred to military custody, i. e., to cases in which his sentence, in its new form, admits of or requires such custody. When a death sentence is commuted, subsequent to confirmation, to one of imprisonment for life or imprisonment, Form J or K in Appendix V to AR with the necessary variations, will be used. See AR 4  See IPC s. 53A.      238  THE ARMY ACT, 1950 WITH NOTES  2.  The order, after promulgation, should be sent to the JAG AHQ, for attachment to the court-martial proceedings.  3.  Prescribed officer see AR.167.  174. Execution of sentence of fine. — When a sentence of fine is imposed by a court-martial under section 69 whether the trial was held within India or not, a copy of such sentence, signed and certified by the confirming officer, or where no confirmation is required, by the officer holding the trial may be sent to any magistrate in India, and such magistrate shall thereupon cause the fine to be recovered in accordance with the provisions of the [Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974)] or any corresponding law in force in (the State of Jammu and Kashmir )1 for the levy of fines as if it were a sentence of fine imposed by such magistrate.  NOTE This provision should be used when the fine imposed by sentence of a court-martial is not recoverable under AA.s.90(f) or 91(h).  175.  Establishment and regulation of military prisons. — The Central Government may set apart any building or part of a building, or any place under its control, as a military prison for the confinement of persons sentenced to imprisonment under this Act.  176.  Informality or error in the order or warrant. — Whenever any person is sentenced to (imprisonment for life)2 or imprisonment under this Act, and is undergoing the sentence in any place or manner in which he might be confined under a lawful order or warrant in pursuance of this Act, the confinement of such person shall not be deemed to be illegal only by reason of any informality or error in or as respects the order, warrant or other document, or the authority by which, or in pursuance whereof such person was brought into or is confined in any such place, and any such order, warrant or document may be amended accordingly.  177.  Power to make rules in respect of prisons and prisoners. —The Central Government may make rules providing— (a)  for the government, management and regulation of military prisons; (b) for the appointment, removal and powers of inspectors, visitors, governors and officers thereof; (c)  for the labour of prisoners undergoing confinement therein, and for enabling persons to earn,by special industry and good conduct, a remission of a portion of their sentence; (d)  for the safe custody of prisoners and the maintenance of discipline among them and the punishment, by personal correction, restraint or otherwise, of offences committed by prisoners; (e)  for the application to military prisons of any of the provisions of the prisons Act, 1894 (IX of 1894), relating to the duties of officers of prisons and the punishment of persons not being prisoners; (f)  for the admission into any prison, at proper times and subject to proper restrictions, of persons with whom prisoners may desire to communicate, and for the consultation by prisoners under trial with their legal advisers without the presence as far as possible of any third party within hearing distance.  178.  Restriction of rule-making power in regard to corporal punishment. — Rules made under section 177 shall not authorise corporal punishment to be inflicted for any offence, nor render the imprisonment more severe than it is under the law for the time being in force relating to civil prisons.  1Substituted by the Adaptation of Laws (No.3) Order 1956. 2Sec IPC.s.53A.

PARDON AND REMISSION.— When any person subject to this Act has been convicted by a court-martial of any offence, the Central Government or the (Chief of the Army Staff)1 or, in the case of a sentence, which he could have confirmed or which did not require confirmation, the officer commanding the army, army corps, division or independent brigade in which such person at the time of conviction was serving or the prescribed officer may—  (a) either with or without conditions which the person sentenced accepts, pardon the person or remit the whole or any part of the punishment awarded; or  (b)  mitigate the punishment awarded; or  (c)  commute such punishment for any less punishment or punishments mentioned in this Act;(Proviso omitted)2.

The powers conferred by this section should not be exercised by an officer holding a command inferior to that of the authority confirming the sentence unless such officer is authorised by such confirming authority or an authority superior to the confirming authority to exercise such power. Similarly, the powers conferred by this section shall not be exercised by an officer mentioned therein if such officer holds a command inferior to that of the authority/officer who has already once taken action under this section, without reference to such latter authority/officer. Regs Army para 473. 5.  (a) A sentence of dismissal might be remitted on the conditions that the person sentenced shall not receive pay in respect of or count service for any purpose during the period spent under dismissal. The conditions, if any, must be clearly stated and the written acceptance of the person obtained. Mitigation or commutation cannot be made conditional. (b)  A \"pardon\\' takes away the conviction, and when a pardon has been granted the record of the conviction must be removed from the pardoned persons\\' conduct sheet and will not be provable against him should he be again tried by a court-martial and convicted of any offence.

(2)  A person whose sentence of Transportation or imprisonment is carried into effect under the provisions of sub-section (1) shall undergo only the unexpired portion of his sentence.  NOTES 1.  'Unexpired portion': This is the period of the sentence less the period the person was in custody in consequence of the sentence i.e., less the period from the effective date of sentence to date of release in consequence of the remission. 2.  See note 3 to AA.s.179.  181.  Reduction, of warrant officer or non-commissioned officer.— When under the provisions of section 77 a warrant officer or a non-commissioned officer is deemed to be reduced to the ranks, such reduction shall, for the purpose of section 179, be treated as a punishment awarded by a sentence of a court-martial.  NOTES 1.  The remission of the punishments mentioned in AA.s.77 would not of itself avoid the reduction to the ranks consequent on the sentence. If it is desired to avoid such reduction to the ranks the reduction may, by reason of this section, be remitted as well. 2.  A NCO sentenced by court-martial to imprisonment etc., is ipso facto reduced to the ranks, and the suspension of his sentence does not cancel or suspend the reduction. There is, however, no legal bar to a person receiving promotion or an appointment whilst under a suspended sentence. 3.  See also note 3 to AA.s.179.  182. Suspension of sentence of (transportation)1 or imprisonment.— (1) Where a person subject to this Act is sentenced by a court-martial to (transportation)1 or imprisonment, the Central Government, the (Chief of the Army Staff)2 or any officer empowered to convene a general or a summary general court-martial may suspend the sentence whether or not the offender has already been committed to prison or to military custody. (2)  The authority or officer specified in sub-section (1) may in, the case of an offender so sentenced direct that until the orders of such authority or officer have been obtained the offender shall not be committed to prison or to military custody. (3)  The powers conferred by sub-sections (1) and (2) may be exercised in the case of any such sentence which has been confirmed, reduced or commuted.  NOTES 1.  AA.ss.182 to 190, which deal with suspension of sentence only apply to sentences of imprisonment for life or imprisonment passed on persons subject to AA but from the word 'dismissal' in AA.s.190(2) it appears that the Parliament intended to exclude officers from the purview of these sections. 2.  The authority/officer specified in sub-sec (1) may in his discretion, issue a general direction that no person under his command sentenced to imprisonment for life or imprisonment is to be committed to prison or to military custody until his orders have been obtained. Sentence of imprisonment exceeding two years will, since only a GCM or SGCM can pass such a sentence, always require confirmation by an officers who will himself be one of the authorities specified in sub-sec (1). 3.

An order putting a suspended sentence into execution must be signed by the competent authority under sub-sec (1); a minute of suspension may be signed by a staff office \"for\" him, so long as it makes it clear that the competent authority/officer himself considered the case and arrived at the decision.  183.  Orders pending suspension—(1) Where the sentence referred to in section 182 is imposed by a court-martial other than a summary court-martial, the confirming officer may when confirming the sentence, direct that the offender be not committed to prison or to military custody until the orders of the authority or officer specified in section 182 have been obtained. (2) Where a sentence of imprisonment is imposed by a summary court-martial the officer holding the trial or the officer authorised to approve of the sentence under sub-section (2) of section 161 may make the direction referred to in sub-section (1).  NOTES 1.  The cases in which and by whom a direction under this section may be recorded are as under: — (a) by the authority/officer specified in AA.s.182(1); see AA.s.182(2) (b) by the confirming officer in the case of any sentence awarded by a DCM unless the confirming officer happens to be one of the authorities specified in AA.s.182(1); (c) in the case of a SCM— (i) the officer holding the trial; or (ii) the officer authorised to approve the sentence under AA.s.161(2). 2. It should be noted that the officer holding the trial can only so direct when passing sentence, the officer authorised to approve under AA.s.161(2) when approving and the confirming officer when confirming.  184. Release on suspension.—  Where a sentence is suspended under sec-tion 182 the offender shall forthwith be released from custody.  NOTE Suspension does not affect the finding or the continuity of the sentence but the offender is released from custody and if in service can carry on his duties.  185.  Computation of period of suspension.— Any period during which the sentence is under suspension shall be reckoned as part of the term of such sentence.  NOTE Suspension of a sentence does not affect its continuity. Under the provisions of AA.s.167, a sentence of imprisonment for life or imprisonment, whether suspended or not, commences on the date on which the original proceedings of the court were signed and runs continuously until it expires.  ',\n",
       " \"186.  Order after suspension.— The authority or officer specified in section 182 may, at any time while a sentence is suspended, order— (a)  that the offender be committed to undergo the unexpired portion of the sentence; or (b)  that the sentence be remitted.  NOTES 1.  If the authority/officer specified in AA.s.187(1) considers at the periodical review that a sentence ought not to remain suspended, he will refer the case to the authority or officer specified in AA.s.182(1) unless he is himself such authority., see notes to AA.s.187. A suspended sentence may however, be referred to the authority/officer mentioned in AA.s.182(1) at any time with a view either to its emission or to the committal of offender to undergo the unexpired portion of the sentence. 2. This section does not contemplate the partial remission of a sentence; the only power of remission under clause (b) is to remit the whole Partial remission must be effected (if at all) under AA.s,179, See AA.s.189  242  THE ARMY ACT, 1950 WITH NOTES  3.  When an offender is committed to prison to undergo the 'unexpired portion' of his sentence, the unexpired portion should be stated in the warrant. As to signing committal warrants, see AR 166. Also see AA.s.185.  187. Reconsideration of case after suspension.— (1) Where a sentence has been suspended, the case may at any time, and shall at intervals of not more than four months, be reconsidered by the authority or officer specified in section 182, or by any general or other officer not below the rank of field officer duly authorised by the authority or officer specified in section 182.  (2)  Where on such reconsideration by the officer so authorised it appears to him that the conduct of the offender since his conviction has been such as to justify a remission of the sentence, he shall refer the matter to the authority or officer specified in section 182.  \",\n",
       " 'NOTES 1.  See notes to AA.s.186. Unless the authority referred to in sub-sec (1) is also one specified in AA.s.182(1), the former can only— (a)  keep a suspended sentence further suspended by ordering it to be brought forward for reconsideration on such and such a date not more than four months ahead; or (b)  refer it to the authority /officer specified in AA.s.182(1)—unless he is himself such authority—with a recommendation either that the offender be committed to undergo the unexpired portion of the sentence or that the sentence be remitted. 2.  Failure to reconsider a suspended sentence at the proper date has no effect upon the sentence; it can be subsequently reconsidered, and a further suspension or a committal may then be ordered.  188.  Fresh sentence after suspension.— Where an offender, while a sentence on him is suspended under this Act, is sentenced for any other offence, then— (a)  if the further sentence is also suspended under this Act, the two sentences shall run concurrently; (b) if the further sentence is for a period of three months or more and is not suspended under this Act, the offender shall also be committed to prison or military custody for the unexpired portion of the previous sentence, but both sentences shall run concurrently; and (c)  if the further sentence is for a period of less than three months and is not suspended under this Act, the offender shall be so committed on that sentence only, and the previous sentence shall, subject to any order which may be passed under section 186 or section 187, continue to be suspended.  NOTES 1.  Clause (b) — (a) Under this clause, the offender is committed to undergo the unexpired portion of the previous sentence from the date the further sentence is effective. An order by a competent military authority under AA.s.182(1) is not required. (b) Committal warrants must, in order to comply with the provisions of the Prisoners Act, 1900 (III of 1900), be forwarded to the authorities of the prison to which the offender is sent. It will generally be convenient to prepare separate warrants; in preparing the warrant in respect of the former sentence care must be taken to state the unexpired portion which the offender has to undergo. 2.  Clause (c).—(a) If dismissal has been added to the further, unsuspended sentence and no order has been passed under AA.s.169, that the imprisonment is to be undergone in military custody, the offender should not be committed to a civil prison until the competent authority under AA.s.182(1) has had an opportunity to order the unexpired portion of the former sentence into execution.

       " 'NOTE The authority or officer referred to in AA.s.182(1) can also in addition exercise the powers of mitigation, remission and commutation under AA.s.179 provided such authority is also one of the authorities specified in the latter section.  190. Effect of suspension and remission or dismissal.— (1) Where in addition to any other sentence the punishment of dismissal has been awarded by a court-martial, and such other sentence is suspended under section 182, then, such dismissal shall not take effect until so ordered by the authority or officer specified in section 182.  (2) If such other sentence is remitted under section 186, the punishment of dismissal shall also be remitted.  ',\n",
       " 'NOTES  1.  Sub-sec (1).—In the case of a sentence of dismissal combined with imprisonment for life or imprisonment which is suspended the dismissal does not take effect until so ordered by the competent authority under AA.s. 182(1). This is so even if the sentence is subsequently ordered into execution by the competent authority or is automatically put into execution under clause (b) of AA.s. 188. A competent authority who orders into execution a sentence of imprisonment for life or of imprisonment other than imprisonment to be undergone in a military prison or military custody should, if dismissal has been added to such sentence, as a rule, order the dismissal to take effect when the offender is received into a civil prison. If the dismissal accompanies a sentence of imprisonment for life or imprisonment which is not suspended, it takes effect as provided in AR 168, that is, when the sentence is one of imprisonment for life or of imprisonment which has to be undergone in a civil prison it takes effect immediately on the offender being received into such a prison and he therefore, ceases to be subject to the Act. In such a case, therefore, the dismissal must be remitted before the sentence of imprisonment for life or imprisonment can be suspended. In this connection see notes to AAs.188.  2.  Sub-sec (2).—The effect of this sub-sec is that whenever dismissal has been added to a sentence of imprisonment for life or imprisonment and such sentence is remitted under AA.s. 186 the dismissal is also automatically remitted. The remission of a sentence of imprisonment for life or imprisonment under AA.s.179 does not operate so as to remit a sentence of dismissal, which accompanied such sentence. If a suspended sentence to which dismissal has been added runs out whilst still under suspension the dismissal should as a rule, be formally remitted under AA.s. 179 by one of the authorities/officers empowered under that section to do so as this sub-sec, does not automatically remit such dismissal                ',\n",
