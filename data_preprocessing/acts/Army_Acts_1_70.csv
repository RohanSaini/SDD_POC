Army_Act_Section_27,"['27.  Remedy of aggrieved officers— Any officer who deems himself wronged by his commanding officer or any superior officer and who on due application made to his commanding officer does not receive the redress to which he considers himself entitled, may complain to the Central Government in such manner as may from time to time be specified by the proper authority.  ', 'NOTES  ', '1.  It is the custom of the service to forward every complaint through the CO if the unit, and an officer would not be justified in deviating from this course, unless the CO should refuse, or unreasonably delay, to forward it. In such a case, an officer, on addressing himself directly to higher authority, should apprise his CO of his doing so, and should observe in the channel of approach to the Central Government each intermediate gradation of command in so far as he is concerned.  2.  CO : see AA.s.3(v); Superior Officer: see AA.s.3(xxiii).  3.  Deems himself wronged: see note 2to AA.s.26  4.  This sec is not available to officers seconded for service with a civil department of a State, in respect of matters arising in the coarse of seconded employment  5. Although the complaint is to the Central Government an intermediate authority is not debarred from expressing his own view of the case, and such an expression of opinion may even in some cases suffice to render further steps unnecessary.

Army_Act_Section_64,"['64. Miscellaneous offences.—  Any person subject to this Act who commits any of the following offences, that is to say, —  (a)  being in command at any post or on the march, and receiving a complaint that any one under his command has beaten or otherwise maltreated or oppressed any person, or has disturbed any fair or market, or committed any riot or trespass, fails to have due reparation made to the injured person or to report the case to the proper authority; or  (b)  by defiling any place, of worship, or otherwise, intentionally insults the religion or wounds the religious feelings of any person; or  (c)  attempts to commit suicide, and in such attempt does any act towards the commission of such offence; or  (d)  being below the rank of warrant officer, when off duty, appears, without proper authority, in or about camp or cantonments, or in or about, or when going to or returning from, any town or bazar, carrying a rifle, sword or other offensive weapon; or  (e)  directly or indirectly accepts or obtains, or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain for himself of for any other person, any gratification as a motive or reward for procuring the enrolment of any person, or leave of absence, promotion or any other advantage or indulgence for any person in the service; or  (f)  commits any offence against the property or person of any inhabitant of, or resident in, the country in which he is serving;  shall,on conviction by court-martial, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned. ', '171     ', 'NOTES 1.  Clause(a)-The offence under this clause can only be committed by a person who is in command.  2.  For definition of riot and trespass, see IPC.ss.146 and 441 respectively.  3 . Clause (b). —The offence under this clause, which is similar to offence under chapter XV of the IPC is based on the Fundamental Right to freedom of religion conferred by Art.27 of the Constitution.  4.  Intentionally.—A person is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences, of his act and the court may infer intention from the circumstances. See note 4 to AA.s.34.  5.  Clause (c). —(a) This offence is the same as the civil offence under IPC.s.309. (b)  A person should not be charged with attempted suicide unless the circumstances of the case make it clear that he seriously intended to take his life. (c) Where the action falls short of a deliberate intent to end his life, the accused could be charged under AA.s.46(c) or 63 (if appropriate); the charge alleging that the accused rendered himself temporarily unfit for duty by reason of his conduct.  (d)  At the summary of evidence and the trial evidence must be given by a medical officer as to the probable effect of the action which the accused took and he should also express his opinion as to the state of mind of the accused at the time of the commission of the alleged offence.  6.  Clause (d).—(a) This offence can only be committed by NCO or sepoy.  (b)  Camp. —See note 13 to AA. s.34. \'Cantonment\' is not restricted to those stations which have been declared to be ""cantonments"" for the purposes of the Cantonments Act,1924 (II of 1924). Troops are considered to be in a cantonment for the purposes of AA when they are quartered in any Station or locality as a permanent, or semi-permanent, arrangement.  (c)  Without proper authority. —See note 3 (a) to AA. s.49.  7.  Clause (e). —(a) Gratification. —This term is not restricted to a pecuniary gratification or a gratification estimable in money. The offence is complete if the gratification is given with the intention indicated, and it is not necessary that the enrolment or other object should be actually procured. An attempt to obtain a gratification (e.g., by asking for it) is punishable equally with the actual receipt of one. An attempt to give a gratification (e.g., an offer of a bribe) is an abetment of the offence by way of instigation and is punishable under AA.s.66 or; 68 as the case may be.  (b)  Any other advantage or indulgence.—Such advantage etc., must be ejusdem generis.  8.  Clause (f). —(a) Offence. —For definition see AA.s.3(xvii). The word ""offence"" here means an offence which would be punishable, if committed in India as a civil offence.  (b)  See note 11 to AA.s.42.It is frequently of the highest importance to conciliate the inhabitants of the country where the troops happen to be, and to induce them to bring provisions and supplies. From this point of view an offence, which in other circumstances would be trivial, may require severe punishment, as for instance, if a trifling theft has the effect of disturbing the confidence of the inhabitants and endangering the supplies of the Army. A person should not be charged under this clause when the offence is committed in India. Elsewhere it is better that a charge should be preferred under AA.s.69 and not under this clause. The charge must set out the specific acts of violence or the specific offence alleged to have been done or committed.']"
Army_Act_Section_38,"['38.  Desertion and aiding desertion.— (1)  Any person subject to this Act who deserts or attempts to desert the service shall, on conviction by court-martial,  if he commits the offence on active service or when under orders for active service, be liable to suffer death or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned; and  if he commits the offence under any other circumstances, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.   (2)  Any person subject to this Act who, knowingly harbours any such deserter shall, on conviction by court-martial, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.  (3)  Any person subject to this Act who, being cognizant of any desertion or attempt at desertion of a person subject to this Act, does not forthwith give notice to his own or some other superior officer, or take any steps in his power to cause such person to be apprehended, shall, on conviction by court-martial, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.  ', 'NOTES  ', '1.  General.—(a)  An offence under sub-section (1) of this section when on active service or under orders for active service should not be dealt with summarily under AA.ss.80, 83 or 84. (b)  When a superior officer directs the case of an offender against whom a charge for desertion has been preferred to be summarily disposed of, he should order the offence to be disposed of as one of absence without leave. See notes to AA.s.39. See generally AA.ss.104 and 105 and Regs Army paras 376 to 381. (c)  Under AA.s.120(3), a CO can try by SCM a NCO or sepoy under his command, for an offence under this section. As a rule a NCO or OR cannot be attached to another unit for purposes of his trial by SCM; but see Regs Army para 381 for the circumstances when a CO other than the CO of the unit to which a NCO or OR properly belongs, can try him by SCM for an offence of desertion or absence without leave.  2  Sub sec.(1).—Desertion is distinguished from absence without leave under AA.s.39; in that desertion or attempt to desert the service implies an intention on the part of      ', '141    the accused either (a) never to return to the service or (b) to avoid some important military duty (commonly known as constructive desertion) e.g., service in a forward area, embarkation for foreign service or service in aid of the civil power and not merely some routine duty or duty only applicable to the accused like a fire piquet duty. A charge under this section cannot lie unless it appears from the evidence that one or other such intention existed; further, it is sufficient if the intention in (a) above was formed at the time during the period of absence and not necessarily at the time when the accused first absented himself from unit/duty station. 3.  A person may be a deserter although he re-enrolls himself, or although in the first instance his absence was legal (e.g. authorised by leave), the criterion being the same, viz., whether the intention required for desertion can properly be inferred from the evidence available (the surrounding facts and the circumstances of the case). 4.  Intention to desert may be inferred from a long absence, wearing of disguise, distance from the duty station and the manner of termination of absence e.g., apprehension but such facts though relevant are only prima facie, and not conclusive, evidence of such intention. Similarly the fact that an accused has been declared an absentee under AA.s.106 is not by itself a deciding factor if other evidence suggests the contrary. 5.  A person subject to the AA charged with desertion may be found guilty of an attempt to desert or of absence without leave, and such a person charged with attempting to desert may be found guilty of being absent without leave provided evidence was avail- able to prove the absence; see AA.s.139(1)and (2). When the absence began more than 3 years before the date of trial, the provisions of AA.s.122 must be borne in mind and complied with. For instance where an accused person is charged with desertion commencing on a date more than three years before the date of trial, he cannot be found guilty under AA. s. 139(1) of absence without leave from that date but such absence must be restricted to a period not exceeding three years immediately prior to the commencement of trial; where such a finding and sentence has been wrongly confirmed, the competent authority under AA.s.163 may substitute a valid finding and pass a sentence for the offence specified or involved in such finding. 6.  When a person subject to AA has been absent from his duty without authority for a period of thirty days, a court of inquiry is mandatory under AA.s.106 but even after such a court of inquiry has been held, the case can still be disposed of summarily under AA.s.80, 83 or 84 but the charge should be laid for absence without leave under AA.s.39. As to inquiring into absence see AR183 also. 7.  AA.s.122 which prescribes the limitation of time for the trial of offences expressly excludes desertion; but where a person other than an officer has subsequently to the commission of the offence served continuously in an exemplary manner for not less than three years, he cannot be tried for such offence of desertion which was committed before the commencement of such three years other than desertion on active service. For \'exemplary service\' see Regs Army para 465. 8. Two or more persons cannot be tried jointly with committing the offence of desertion under this sub sec. 9.  AA.ss.90(a) and 91(a) read with P and A Regs provide for automatic forfeiture of pay and allowances for every day a person subject to AA is absent on desertion or without leave. 10.  As to forfeiture of service for pension or gratuity, which follows upon desertion, and restoration of service so forfeited, see Regs pension (Part I) Reg 123. The period between desertion and apprehension/surrender does not, under the prescribed conditions of enrolment; reckon as service towards discharge. Service rendered previous to desertion, though forfeited for purposes of pension or gratuity, reckons as service towards discharge.  As to a person who absents himself from his corps or department and enrolls again, see AA.s.43 and notes thereto. 11. (a) While framing charges of desertion or absence without leave care must be taken to ensure that the particulars allege and the prosecution prove, both the date when the absence began, and the date when it ended (by return, surrender, apprehension or re-enrolment). It is not sufficient to allege and prove absence ""on or about"" a certain date, or ""from some date subsequent to……………”. (b) Commencement of absence under this section or AA.s.39 may be proved in the following ways : (i) orally by a witness who found the accused absent, or   ', '142     (ii) by production by a witness on oath, who can identify the accused as the person named in   (aa) the declaration of a court of inquiry held under AAs.106 as entered in the court-martial book; or  (bb) a certified true copy of the above declaration on IAFD-918; or ', ""Provided AA.s 106 and AR 183 have been compiled with (cc)  an entry in a part II Order; provided the entry is one that is made in Regimental orders/books in pursuance of military duty and the orders purported to be signed by the CO or by the officer whose duty it is to make such record AA.s.142(3). Such an entry should only be used as evidence where no direct evidence and no declaration of a court of inquiry is available and even then it is only prima facie evidence and may be rebutted; or (dd)  a copy of such an order purporting to be certified to be a true copy by the officer having custody of such order; see AA.s.142(4). (c)  Termination of absence may be proved in the following ways : — (i)  by oral evidence of a witness who apprehended the accused or to whom the accused surrendered; or (ii)  by production by a witness on oath, who can identify the accused as the person named in : (aa)  a certificate on IAFD-910 stating the fact, date and place of surrender or apprehension and the manner in which the accused was dressed and signed by a police officer not below the rank of an officer in charge of a police station to whom the accused surrendered or by whom he was apprehended AA.s.142(6); or (bb)  where the surrender was made to an officer or other person subject to AA or any portion of the regular Army or where the accused was apprehended by an officer or other person subject to AA, a similar certificate signed by the 'proper' officer : AA.s.142(5) (Also see Regs Army para 378); or (cc)  a Part II Order showing the taking on strength properly signed in accordance with AA.s.142(3); or (dd)  a certified true copy of such order in accordance with AA.s.142(4); or (ee)  where the absence terminated by fraudulent enrolment in the regular Army, the enrolment paper or certified true copy thereof. AA.s.141(2).  12.  The commencement of an absence cannot be proved by production of an absence report as this is not a regimental book under Regs Army para 610.  13  Attempt to desert.— To establish an attempt to desert, some act which, if completed, would constitute desertion must be proved, e.g., a soldier is arrested in the act of leaving his unit lines without authority, dressed in plain clothes and carrying his personal kit, when the circumstances indicate that he intends to desert. The test is whether the act, or series of acts, in the course of which the offender is apprehended or surrenders, would, if completed, amount to desertion. A mere preparation to desert, if unaccompanied by any such act which if completed would amount to. Desertion does not constitute an offence of attempting to desert. But if there is evidence that the offender actually absented himself from the place where his duty required him to be and that he intended to desert, the offence is complete and a charge for desertion, not for an attempt to desert should be framed. Attempt to desert is itself made a substantive offence, and a charge for the same should be preferred under this sub sec and not under AA.s.65.  14.  For definition of active service; see AA.s.3(i).  15.  Abetment of desertion of a person subject to the AA can be charged under AA.s.66.  16.  Sub sec (2) : Knowingly.—see note 18 to AA.s34.  17.  Harbours: see note 19 to AA.s.34.  18.  Any such deserter.—A charge under this sub sec can lie when the offence of desertion has already been committed.     "", '143     ', ""19.  Sub sec.(3).— To substantiate a charge the particulars must specify the precise steps which, it is alleged by the prosecution, were within the power of the accused to take to cause the deserter or intending deserter to be apprehended. The times at which the accused became aware of the desertion or attempt to desert and gave notice to a superior officer, are material and should be disclosed in the charge.  20.  Superior officer means the 'Superior Officer' in relation to the offender, not to the deserter or intending deserter,""]"

When a guard etc., commander   wilfully or without reasonable excuse refuses to receive a person committed to his charge, he commits an offence under AA.s.49(a) in respect of his improper refusal. The fact that no account in writing of the type required in this clause was received by the guard etc., commander from the person committing the person at the time of committal or within 48 hours thereafter would not entitle the guard commander to refuse custody or charge or to effect the subsequent release of any such person, 5.

Clauses (a) and (b).—A report (which must be in writing), return, certificate or other document mentioned herein must be one executed by the accused in his capacity as a person subject to AA and not in some civil capacity. The 'other document' which should be ejusdem generis, should be specified in the statement and particulars of the charge. A trivial error in the report should not, in the absence of fraud or bad faith, be made the ground of a charge under these clauses. 3.  'Made by him'. —Making a document means creating or bringing it into existence e.g., writing or typing it as distinguished from sealing, signing or otherwise executing it. 4.  In determining whether or not it was the duty of the accused to ascertain the accuracy of the report, etc., referred to in the charge, the court may use their military knowledge (AA.s.134). 5.  (a) If a person makes false entries as to payments made in a book which it was his duty to keep in his official capacity he may be charged with knowingly making false statement under clause (a) or, if it can be shown that he intended to defraud by means of the entries, he may be charged with knowingly making a fraudulent statement. Similarly, if he omits to make in the book entries of payments made by him or to him he may; if the evidence justifies such a course, be charged with knowingly making such omissions with intent to defraud under clause (b). (b) When the accused has on the same occasion made a number of fraudulent entries on an acquittance roll, etc., an omnibus charge under AA. s.52(f) would be preferable to a number of charges under clause (a). 6.  Knowingly. —See note 18 to AA. s.34. 7.  It is wrong to make a statement made by an accused in defence or in explanation of an offence imputed to him, the subject of a charge against him, such statement or explanation is strictly analogous to a plea of 'not guilty' before a court-martial, thus casting the burden of proof on the other side, and the accused is at liberty to make at any preliminary inquiry the best excuse he can. 8.  Clause (c). —The suppression, etc., of a document is not an offence under this clause if it is affected only with intent to deceive and not to defraud. The question as to the duty of the accused to preserve or produce the document will be determined by the court using their military knowledge. The particulars of a charge under this clause should show the capacity or appointment on account of which it was the accused's duty to produce or preserve the document. 9.

The officer who recorded the proceedings, or some other person, who heard the evidence given, must prove by oral evidence this fact and that the accused was duly sworn/affirmed. He may however, use the record to refresh his memory, (IEA.ss.159 and 160). The proceedings of the court are, however, admissible to prove that the occasion on which the alleged false statement was made was a properly constituted court martial or court of inquiry. 4.

Army_Act_Section_52,"['52. Offences in respect of property. —Any person subject to this Act who commits  any of the following offences, that is to say, —  (a)  commits theft of any property belonging to the Government, or to any military, naval or air force mess, band or institution, or to any person subject to military, naval or air force law; or  (b)  dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use any such property; or  (c)  commits criminal breach of trust in respect of any such property; or  (d)  dishonestly receives or retains any such property in respect of which any of the offences under clauses (a), (b) and (c) has been committed, knowing or having reason to believe the commission of such offence; or  (e)  wilfully destroys or injures any property of the Government entrusted to him; or  (f)  does any other thing with intent to defraud, or to cause wrongful gain to one person or wrongful loss to another person;shall, on conviction by court-martial, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.  ', 'NOTES  ', '1.  Offences under this section should not be dealt with summarily under AA.s.80, 83 or 84. Before trial is ordered on charges under this section, reference should be made to the DJAG Command concerned: See Regs Army paras 432 and 458. 2.  A person charged before a court-martial with an offence under clause (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section may be found guilty of any other of these offences with which he might have been charged (AA.s.139(5)). 3.  Clause (a): —(a) For definition of theft see IPC.s.378 in part III. (b) \'Any property\' means any moveable property.  (c) See IPC.s.27 for the implication of the term ""Possession"". 4.  (a) If the stolen property has been recovered, it should be produced in court and identified by its owner and by any other witnesses who mention it in their evidence. If it has not been recovered its value or approximate value should be entered in the particulars of the charge and proved in evidence so that the court, if it convicts the accused, may add an award of stoppages to its sentence. (b) where an offender is sentenced by court-martial to be placed under stoppages in respect of any property stolen, etc., by him, due allowance must be made, in enforcing such stoppages, for money, or the value of any property found upon him and appropriated by way of restitution under AA.s.151. 5. Captured enemy property becomes the property of the Government. 6.  (a)  One of the essential ingredients of the offence of theft is that the property must be taken out of the possession of another person. It is not necessary that the property should have been owned by such person. When a person has the \'physical\' or ""constructive possession of property, dishonest removal of the same from the possession of such person without his consent constitutes theft.  (b)  Stealing from a person subject to military law is regarded as a particularly disgraceful military offence, considering that in the daily routine of barrack life, persons must constantly leave exposed their arms, uniform and equipment as well as their private property, such as money, watches, etc., trusting to the honour of their comrades. 7.  For the presumptions which a court may draw in respect of recent possession of stolen property, see IEA.s.114 illustration (a).  ', '159     ', ""8.  If the property belongs to some person or institution not included in the categories contained in this clause, the accused can only be charged under AA.s.69 or 52(f) or dealt with by the civil power. 9.  Every instance of theft should be laid as a separate charge unless they form part of the same transaction. 10.  Clause (b): (a) For civil offence of criminal misappropriation see IPC.s.403 (Part III). (b) 'Any property' means any moveable property. (c) For definition of 'dishonestly' see IPC.s.24. Also see IPC.s.23. "", ""11.  (a) 'To misappropriate' means to set apart for or to assign to the wrong person or a wrong use. (b) 'Converts to his own use’. —There must be actual conversion of the thing appropriated to the use of some person other than the person entitled thereto. Mere retention of property would not warrant a conviction under this clause; unless there is evidence that the accused used that property; for instance when a clerk received certain sums on various dates but entered them in the accounts on each occasion some days after and it was found that the clerk was not in difficulties and did not use the amount, the mere retention by him of the money for some days would not constitute an offence under this clause. "", '12.  Difference between theft and criminal misappropriation. —In theft the object of the offender always is to take property which is in the possession of a person out of that person\'s possession; and the offence is complete as soon as the offender has moved the property in order to dishonest taking of it. In criminal misappropriation, the offender is already in possession of the property; and is either innocently or lawfully in possession of it, because either he has found it or it is entrusted to him, or his possession, if not strictly lawful, is not punishable as an offence because he has acquired it under some mistaken notion of right in himself or of, consent given by another. It is the dishonest misappropriation or conversion to his use that constitutes the offence. 13. (a) A mere error or irregularity in accounts or a mistaken mis- application of property does not constitute an offence under this clause. There must be an intent to defraud on the part of the accused either for the benefit of himself or some other person. This must be particularly remembered in the case, for example, of an NCO\'s accounts getting into confusion through the neglect or carelessness of his superiors. Neglect or failure to supervise that the account is maintained strictly according to service regulations frequently leads to loss of funds and property, and also exposes the subordinates to grave temptation in relation to their accounts.  (b) To secure a conviction on a charge under this clause it is not necessary for the prosecution to prove that the accused intended permanently to deprive the public or other owner of the property, provided the court is satisfied that the accused or some other person benefited and that the owner of the property suffered. In other words, a person may still be guilty of the offence, even though he has repaid the money which he had misappropriated, provided that at the time of such misappropriation he had a dishonest intent. The term dishonest misappropriation\' includes temporary as well as permanent misappropriation of that description. See IPC.s.403 explanation 1. (c) If no evidence is forthcoming as to the particular mode of misappropriation, the court may, in the absence of explanation from the accused, infer that the property was misappropriated from the fact of its not having been properly utilised or accounted for. 14. Each instance of misappropriation should be in a separate charge unless they all form part of the same transaction. 15. The value of the property alleged to have been misappropriated should be entered in the particulars of the charge and proved in evidence so that the court, if it convicts the accused, may award stoppages.  16. Clause(c):Criminal breach of trust; for definition, see IPC,s.405. 17.  (a) To constitute an offence under, this clause, there must be dishonest misappropriation by a person in whom confidence is placed as to the custody or management      of the property in respect of which the breach of trust is charged. There must be an entrustment which, in its most general significance, imports a handing over the possession for some purpose which may not imply the conferring of any proprietary right at all.  (b) A person is said to be entrusted with dominion over property when it remains legally in the owner\'s possession but he is given a limited authority to deal with it. 18.Criminal misappropriation and criminal breach of trust :-In criminal misappropriation the property comes into the possession of the offender by some casualty or otherwise, and he, afterwards misappropriates it. In the case of criminal breach of trust the offender is lawfully entrusted with the property and he dishonestly misappropriates the same or wilfully suffers any other person to do so, instead of discharging the trust attached to it. 19.  Clause (d): Dishonestly—See IPC.s.24. Also see IPC.s.23. 20. The offence of dishonestly receiving property under this clause has practically the same meaning as under IPC.s.411 except that this clause is only limited to property of the description mentioned in clause (a). 21. Receives or retains.—A person cannot be convicted of receiving if he had no guilty knowledge at the time of receipt. But he is guilty of \'retaining\' if he subsequently knows or has reason to believe that the property was obtained by theft, criminal misappropriation or criminal breach of trust. The offence of dishonest retention may be completed without any guilty knowledge at the time of receipt. A person who is proved to have stolen etc., property cannot be convicted of retaining it. 22 .Clause(e):Wilfully destroys or injures.—A charge for destroying or injuring the property here mentioned must be laid under this clause, and not under AA.s.69. The prosecutor must adduce evidence which will either prove, or enable the court to infer, that the injury was not accidental or done by some other person. If the injury appears to be the result of neglect, it will be for the court to determine whether the neglect was wilful and intended to injure the property, or was mere carelessness. In the latter case no offence under this clause would be committed. The pecuniary amount of damage or injury caused must be stated in the particulars of the charge and proved in evidence by calling an expert witness if necessary, to enable \'the court to award stoppages in case of conviction. 23.  Clause (f): \'Does any other thing\'.— An act or omission which would fall under any other clause or any other section of AA should not be made the subject matter of a charge under this clause. But in doubtful cases, the charge should be laid under this clause. 24. (a) \'With intent to defraud\'. —A person is said to do a thing fraudulently if he does that thing with intent to defraud but not, otherwise. IPC.s.25   (b) The terms \'fraud\' and \'defraud\' are not found defined in the IPC. The word \'defraud\' is of double meaning in the sense that it either may or may not imply deprivation. Whenever the words \'fraud\' or \'intent to defraud\' or \'fraudulently\' occur in the definition of a crime two elements at least are essential to the commission of the crime; namely first, deceit or an intention to deceive or in some cases mere secrecy; and secondly, either actual injury or possible injury or an intent to expose some person either to actual injury or to a risk of possible injury by means of that deceit or secrecy. This intent is very seldom the only or the principal intention entertained by; the fraudulent person, whose principal object in nearly every case is his own advantage. The ""injurious deception"" is usually intended only as a means to an end, though this does not prevent it from being intentional. A practically conclusive test as to the fraudulent character of a deception for criminal purposes is this; did the author of the deceit derive any advantage from it, which he could not have had if the truth had been known ? If so, it is hardly possible that advantage should not have had an equivalent in loss, or risk of loss to some one else; and if so, there was fraud.  (c) A general intention to defraud, without the intention of causing wrongful gain to one person or wrongful loss to another, would be sufficient to support a conviction. In order to prove an intent to defraud & it is not at all necessary that there should have been 8-609 DMR&F(ND)/80        some person defrauded, or who might possibly have been defrauded. A person may have an intent to defraud, and yet there may not be any person who could be defrauded by his act. It should, however, be noted that an intent only to deceive is not enough. (d) When it is material to prove an intent to defraud, evidence may be given of similar offences by the accused.  25 . Wrongful loss or wrongful gain: See IPC.s.23 (Part III). 26.  (a) In order to constitute an offence under this clause, it is not sufficient to couple the description of an act which can bear an innocent construction with an averment of intent to defraud. The act alleged to have been committed with intent to defraud must itself appear from the particulars of the charge to be a wrong act though it need not necessarily amount to an offence under the ordinary criminal law. (b) Mere irregularity in accounts, due to incompetence or ignorance of bookkeeping, would not be sufficient under this clause, to constitute an offence as no fraudulent conduct is involved. However acts such as, with intent to defraud, presenting for signature acquittance rolls, containing entries known to be false; or charging money for railway warrants; tickets, or vouchers, to which a person is entitled free of charge, would all amount to offences of a fraudulent nature for the purposes of this clause.']"
Army_Act_Section_54,"['54.  Making away with equipment. —Any person subject to this Act who commits any of the following offences, that is to say, --  (a) makes away with, or is concerned in making away with, any arms, ammunition, equipment, instruments, tools, clothing or any other thing being the property of the Government issued to him for his use or entrusted to him; or  (b)  loses by neglect anything mentioned in clause (a); or  (c) sells, pawns, destroys or defaces any medal or decoration granted to him, shall, on conviction by court-martial, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend in the case of the offences specified in clause (a) to ten years, and in the case of the offences specified in the other clauses to five years, or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned. ', 'NOTES 1.  Clause (a).—In the absence of some positive act of making away with e.g. pawning, selling etc., a charge of making away with should not be preferred under this clause, When, therefore, articles of the description in the clause are found to be merely deficient through, the culpability of a soldier, it would be proper to prefer a charge under clause  (b) of losing by neglect the articles in question, The particular mode of making    ', '162     away with should be alleged in the particulars although it does not affect the kind of offence, but only its gravity in relation to the amount of the sentence to be imposed on conviction. 2. Before an accused can be convicted under this clause, evidence must be adduced at the trial that he had been issued with the articles either by (a) examining a witness who actually issued the articles to the accused, or (b) by a witness on oath producing any receipt for the articles and proving the signature of the accused, or (c) by oral evidence that on a certain date prior to the offence the accused was in possession of those articles e.g., at a kit inspection. 3. (a) A charge under clause (a) or (b) of making away with or losing etc., property not mentioned in those clauses e.g., mess property or property of a comrade would be bad though if the act amounted to theft, dishonest misappropriation or criminal breach of trust, it would be punishable under AA.s.52 or 69; if the facts show wilful act or neglect, the person might in certain circumstances be charged with an offence under AA.s.63. (b) Any other thing should be ejusdem  generis i.e., part of the accused\'s kit which he is bound to maintain or his general military equipment supplied by the Government; such \'other thing\' should be specified in the statement and particulars of the charge. 4. Clothing in this clause may include hospital clothing issued to a person subject to AA, or civilian clothing issued from military sources. 5. Whenever it is desired that the offender should, on conviction of an offence under this clause or clause(b), be awarded stoppages under AA.s.71(1) in respect of the value of the articles which need be made good to the Govt/public, then the value must be stated in the particulars of the charge [AR30(6) ] and proved as follows: (a) Value of an article having an official value will be proved by calling a witness who can, on oath, estimate the value (inclusive of authorised departmental expenses) of the article at the date of the offence upon the basis of its age and/or condition and by reference to the regulations which should be produced for fixing the value of the article at that age or in that condition. (b) When the article has not an official value, competent evidence is required to prove the approximate value. (c)When an article has been damaged but not rendered unserviceable, competent evidence is required to prove the pecuniary amount of the damage, which will be either the cost of repairing it, if it can be repaired, or the cost of repair plus any ultimate loss of value due to the act of the accused. 6. Clause (b).—This is not intended to punish a person for a deficiency in his kit occasioned by accident or mere carelessness but for loss by culpable neglect. On the other hand, the fact that a person has not got his arms, service necessaries, etc., at a time when it was his duty to have them (i.e., at a kit inspection), is prima facie evidence of his having lost them by neglect. The onus of proving ""neglect"" always remains on the prosecution. But once the loss is proved, the court is entitled to expect the accused to offer some explanation of it, and if he gives none, it is open to the court to conclude that the loss must have been due to his negligence. If he gives an explanation which may reasonably be true and which if true is inconsistent with negligence, even if the court is not convinced of its truth, he must be acquitted, since a reasonable doubt as to his negligence then remains. 7.  Where a court of inquiry (as laid down in AA.s.106) has been held and has found a person to be deficient in certain articles, then upon his trial under this clause a certified copy of the record in the regimental books, on IAFD-918, showing that such articles were deficient is prima facie evidence that they were deficient and of their value, if stated (AA.s.142(3) and (4)). If no evidence, except IAFD-918 is obtainable, the prosecution would be justified in proceeding on that alone, and if no evidence is given on the part of the accused to disprove the facts stated therein, the court may convict. Where, however, the accused gives or produces evidence in contradiction of the declaration of the court of inquiry with regard to any of the articles in question, it will become necessary for the prosecution to produce other evidence in support of its case in so far as such articles are concerned for which purpose the court might, if necessary, grant an adjournment under AR 82. If for any reasonable cause, such as lapse of time since the deficiency arose, no witnesses are available to rebut the evidence produced by the accused, ', '163     the court must use its discretion as to its finding in respect of the articles in question. In all cases. where IAFD-918 is not produced at the trial evidence must be produced to show that at some previous specified date the accused has been in possession of the articles alleged to be deficient. In cases of desertion or absence without leave the form will usually show as missing some articles which the person in fact brings back with him. The court must not, of course, convict him in respect of articles so returned if in serviceable condition or those the value of which has not to be made good to the public. 8 losing by neglect the property of a comrade, or a decoration, is not an offence under this clause as that class of property or decoration is not mentioned therein.

NOTES 1. An offence under this section should not be dealt with summarily under AA.s.83 or 84. 2.  For behaviour to be blameworthy under this section, it must be unbecoming both the accused's position and the character expected of him as an officer/JCO/WO i.e., his refusal to be swayed by considerations other than duty to the service does not, as the word is commonly understood, admit of different degrees or standards at any rate in that class and cannot therefore vary with his position i.e., the rank or appointment held by him except when the behaviour complained of is of a social character i.e., it offends the accepted rules of social behaviour and thus is unbecoming the character from a moral view point, in which case the culpability would depend upon the position held by the accused. Where behaviour complained of is not punishable under this section, a charge may lie under AA.s.63, if such conduct is prejudicial both to good order and military discipline. 3.  The offence under this section must be distinguished from the offence of disgraceful conduct of a cruel, indecent or unnatural kind under AA.s.46(a). As a rule a charge should not be preferred under this section where such behaviour amounts to a specific offence under any other section of AA. The conduct is not brought within the scope of this section by merely applying to it the statutory language; and a court is not warranted in convicting unless of the opinion that the conduct proved was unbecoming of the accused's position and the character expected of him as an officer etc., having regard to its nature and to the circumstances in which it took place. 4.  This section is not applicable to civilians with relative rank and subject to AA under sec. 2(l)(i). 5.  This section is frequently invoked in cases where an officer has given stumer cheques. Such a charge should only be preferred where it is clear from the evidence from the bank that the officer acted in such reckless manner as is tantamount to fraud. 6.

Army_Act_Section_41,"['41.  Disobedience to Superior officer.— (1) Any person subject to this act who disobeys in such manner as to show a wilful defiance of authority any lawful command given personally by his superior officer in the execution of his office whether the same is given orally, or in writing or by signal or otherwise shall, on conviction by court-martial be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to fourteen years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.  (2)  Any person subject to this Act who disobeys any lawful command given by his superior officer shall, on conviction by court-martial.  if he commits such offence when on active service, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to fourteen years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned; and if he commits such offence when on active service, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.  ', 'NOTES  ', '1.  Offences under this section, when on active service, should not be dealt with summarily under AA.s.80, 83 or 84. 2.  An offence under this section cannot be made the subject of a joint charge. 3.  Lawful Command.—The command must be a specific command to an individual i.e., it must be capable of individual execution by the person to whom it is addressed and justified by military, as well as by civil, law and usage, e.g., a command addressed by a superior officer to four persons to ""dismiss"" is for the purposes of this section a lawful military command to each of the four persons so addressed. The command must relate to military duty that is to say disobedience to it must tend to impede, delay or prevent a military proceeding. The disobedience must have reference to the time at which the command is to be obeyed. If the command be a lawful command, and demands a prompt and immediate compliance, hesitation or unnecessary delay in obeying it may be sufficient to constitute an offence under this section. A person who on being ordered to do a certain thing at some time, uses words expressing an intention not to obey and is immediately confined, does not commit an offence under this section. He should be charged under AA.s.40(c) or 63 according to the circumstances of the case. A neglect to carry out an order due to misapprehension, or forgetfulness, does not constitute an offence under this section though non-compliance with an order through forgetfulness or negligence would be chargeable under AA.s.63. 4.  Sub sec (1).—(a)  The essential ingredients of this offence are that the disobedience should show a wilful defiance of authority and should be disobedience of a lawful command given personally in the execution of his office by a superior officer; in fact, it would ordinarily be such an offence as would fall under AA.s,37 if two or more persons joined in it. In order, therefore, to convict an accused of an offence under this sub-sec it must be shown (i) that a lawful command was given by a superior officer, (ii) that it was given personally by such officer; (iii) that it was given by such officer in the execution of his office; (iv) that the accused disobeyed it, not from any misunderstanding or slowness but so as to show a wilful defiance of his superior officer\'s authority. (b) The disobedience must be willful and deliberate, and distinguished from disobedience arising from forgetfulness or misapprehension (which might, however, be punished under AA.s. 63). It is not disobedience in the sense of this section if a sepoy declines to sign his accounts on the grounds that they are incorrect; nor his failure to obey a command where obedience would be physically impossible. (c)  Religious scruples, however, bonafide, afford no justification for disobedience of commands which are clearly lawful. (d)  Disobedience to an order of a general nature, as for instance to a regimental order or a para of regulations, is not chargeable under this section but under AA.s.42(e) or 63.  5. (a) Superior officer; see AA.s.3(xxiii).—A \'superior officer\' whose command has been restricted, either by the terms of his commission or by regulations, cannot give a lawful command to a person who is, by the terms of such restrictions, placed outside his control. (b)  Disobedience of a lawful order given by a person who is not a superior officer within the meaning of AA.s.3(xxiii) may be punishable under AA.s.63 if the disobedience was prejudicial to good order and military discipline; for instance, a civilian cannot give a ""lawful command"" under this section to a soldier employed under him; but it may well be the soldier\'s duty as such to do the act indicated, and, if so, he may be punished for not doing it under AA.s.63. The particulars of the charge should clearly show that the disobedience was prejudicial to good order and military discipline because the soldier had been placed under the orders of the civilian by a superior military authority. (c)  The particulars of the charge must set out the name of the superior officer and a charge for disobeying an order given by two different superior officers would be bad for duplicity. AR 30(1).  6.  In the execution of his office; see note 7 to AA.s.40.  7.  A court trying an accused for an offence under this sub sec could, if it was not satisfied that the order was given in the execution of the superior\'s office, find the accused guilty of an offence under sub sec (2) provided that in all other respects an offence under this section had been committed (AA.s.139(7)).  8.  Sub sec. (2).—The offence under this sub sec is a less grave offence when not committed on active service and consists of disobedience of any lawful command given by a superior officer but not accompanied by the essential elements of the graver offence under sub sec (1).  9.  The particulars of the charge must specify the command, the name of the superior officer giving it, the fact of disobedience and if the charge is laid under sub sec (1) also that it was given personally by superior officer in the execution of his office specifying the nature of the offence and the manner in which the disobedience showed a willful defiance of authority.']"
Army_Act_Section_39,"['39.  Absence without leave.— Any person subject to this Act who commits any of the following offences, that is to say,— (a)  absents himself without leave; or (b)  without sufficient cause overstays leave granted to him; or (c)  being on leave of absence and having received information from proper authority that any corps, or portion of a corps, or any department, to which he belongs, has been ordered on active service, fails, without sufficient cause, to rejoin without delay; or (d)  without sufficient cause fails to appear at the time fixed at the parade or place appointed for exercise or duty; or (e)  when on parade, or on the line of march, without sufficient cause or without leave from his superior officer, quits the parade or line of march; or (f)  when in camp or garrison or elsewhere, is found beyond any limits fixed, or in any place, prohibited by any general/ local or other order, with out a pass or written leave from his superior officer; or (g)  without leave from his superior officer or without due cause, absents himself from any school when duly ordered to attend there;  shall,on conviction by court-martial, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.  NOTES  1.  Two or more accused should not be jointly charged with an offence under this section.  2.  Clause (a): The criterion between desertion and absence without leave is intention. Where all the ingredients of the offence of desertion are present except an intention not to return to the service or to avoid some important military duty, the offence will be one of absence without leave or any other offence of this genus e.g., failure to appear at the time fixed at the parade.  3.  (a)  Absence without leave must not be involuntary absence e.g., due to illness or being taken into civil or military custody, whether on surrender or apprehension. However, the mere reporting by an absentee to a provost officer or M.C.O. or the fact that such provost officer or M.C.O. orders the absentee to return to his unit will not terminate the voluntary absence; which will continue to run until the absentee rejoins his unit.  (b)  To render an absence involuntary there must be some physical impracticability, outside the control of the offender, that prevents his return to his unit. Inability to return to his unit through intoxication which is an offence under AA.s.48 will not make such absence involuntary nor would an inability which arises through lack of money or loss of his railway or other ticket. Further, where the absence without leave was originally voluntary and has by change of circumstances, subsequently become involuntary the offender may be convicted of absence for the whole period. Similarly, an absence that was originally involuntary becomes voluntary, if the offender fails to return to his unit at the earliest practicable moment e.g., failure to return on release from a civil prison.  (c)  Where the prosecution proves that the accused was absent and that he had not been granted leave, the court may, in the absence of any satisfactory explanation by the accused, infer that the absence was voluntary.    ', '144     ', '4.  (a)  A court considering a charge under this section should consider \'\'was the accused at the place where his duty required him to be?"" (b)  An offence under this section is one of absence without leave, and not merely absence. Leave of absence must be notified to the applicant for such leave. A person who has applied for leave, and departs from his unit before it is actually granted, commits the offence of being absent without leave, even though the leave had been granted but not notified to him. (c)  When evidence has been given of the accused\'s absence, or failure to appear at the place required, and that evidence is sufficient to raise an inference that he had no leave of absence, then the court may look to the accused to provide evidence, by way of defence, for his ""leave"", ""sufficient cause"" or ""due cause"" as the case may be.  5. (a)  For proof of commencement and termination of absence see note 11to AA.s.38.  (b)  The particulars of a charge of absence without leave should state the date when the absence began and terminated. Where the exact hour of the absence is material for the purpose of proving a whole day\'s absence, as it may be under the provisions of AA.s.92, the hour of the offender\'s departure and return should also be stated in the particulars of the charge. (c)  Where, for some reason, it is not possible to prove the exact dates of commencement and termination of the absence, but it is possible to show that an absentee was at some place other than his place of duty ,at charge under AA.s.63 alleging that he was improperly at one place; whereas his duty required him to be elsewhere may be preferred.  6.  Under AA.s.90(a), read with P & A Regs (Officers), an officer automatically forfeits all pay and allowances due to him for every day he absents himself without leave or overstays the period of his leave unless a satisfactory explanation has been given to his CO and has been approved by the Central Govt. AA.s.91(a),read with P & A Regs (OR), makes such deductions also automatic in the case of persons subject to AA other than officers; the CO of such absentee can, however, remit such penal deduction if the absence does not exceed five days; AR.195(b). The penal deductions under AAss.90(a) and 91(a) may be made without the absentee being convicted by court-martial or dealt with summarily under AA.ss.80, 83 or 84.  7. Under AA.s.139(1) and (2), a person subject to AA and charged with desertion or attempted desertion may be found guilty of absence without leave but not vice versa. Also see note 5 toAA.s.38.  8.  When a person has been absent without leave for 30 clear days or has overstayed his leave without sufficient cause for that period, a court of inquiry will be assembled under AA,s.106. Also see AR 183.  9.  Under AA.s.120(3), a CO can try by SCM a NCO or a sepoy under his command for an offence under this clause. For the circumstances when a CO other than a CO of the unit to which a NCO or OR properly belongs, can try an offence under this clause see note (c) to AA.s.38.  10.  If at any trial for desertion or absence without leave, overstaying leave or not rejoining when warned for service, the accused states in his defence any sufficient or reasonable cause for his absence and refers in support to any officer in the service of the Govt. it is the duty of the court to address such officer if it appears that such officer may prove or disprove the accused\'s statement;  AA.s.143. Failure to comply with this provision may result in annulment of the proceedings.  11.  Clause (b).—This offence is basically the same as in clause (a); except that the absence becomes illegal only after the expiry of his authorised leave; whereas under clause (a)  the absence is illegal ab-initio.  12. If it is proved that a person subject to the AA. has overstayed his leave, it will be for him to show that he had sufficient cause (e.g., sickness or the unexpected interruption of the ordinary means of transit) for doing so. If, however, any evidence as to the cause of his failure to return is known to the prosecutor, it should be adduced, leaving it to the court to decide as to the sufficiency of such cause.      ', '13.  Clause (c)— Charges under clauses (c), (d), (e) or (g) should not ordinarily be preferred as any offence under those clauses must almost invariably amount to an offence under clause (a) and a charge under the latter clause is simple to prove.  14.  Without sufficient cause: see note13 above.  15.  Corps—sees AR 187(3). Department.—see AA.S.3(ix). Active service.—see AA.s.3(i).  16.  Clause (d).—(a) before a conviction can be obtained under this clause, it must be proved that the time was fixed and the place appointed by competent authority, and that the accused was aware of this fact. These facts are sometimes difficult to prove and therefore a charge of absence without leave under clause (a) is usually more practicable. See also note13 above.  (b)  A person who is late for parade commits an offence under this clause, equally with one who is altogether absent.  (c)  Absence from a parade etc., through intoxication should not be charged under this section but underAA.s.48 for intoxication. Ignorance of the order for the parade, although exposing the offender to a charge under AA.s.63, for failing to acquaint himself with the order as required by Regs Army para 324, will not render him liable to a conviction under this clause. Where a reasonable misapprehension of the order exists, based on lack of clarity in the terms of the order itself, this may, in certain circumstances amount to a good defence to the charge.  17.  Clause (f).—\'Camp\' includes a bivouac and any quarters, shelter, or other place where troops are temporarily lodged.  18.  \'General, local or other order\'s—The orders specified in this clause are standing orders or orders in writing and applicable continuously over a period of time to persons present in a certain geographical area or in a certain military formation. Ignorance of the order is no excuse if the order is one which the accused ought, in the ordinary course, to know. But a misapprehension reasonably arising from want of clarify in the order is a ground for exculpation. The existence of the order must be proved by producing it or a certified copy where so permissible under AA.s.142(4) on oath/affirmation to the court. A written order cannot be proved by oral testimony. Evidence must also be led to show that the order was duly posted or brought to the notice of the accused, or that he was otherwise in a position to be acquainted with its contents.  19.  (a) A charge alleging ""without a pass or written leave from his superior officer would be a good charge under this clause, since it is a single offence for him to have neither a pass nor written leave. On the other hand, a charge alleging ""beyond the limits fixed by general or local orders"" would be bad since it might be one offence to be beyond the limits fixed by general orders, and another offence to be beyond the limits fixed by local orders (see AR 30). (b) Without a pass or written leave from his superior officer.—These words are in the nature of an exception, and on being proved that the accused was found beyond fixed limits, it will rest on him to show that he had the proper authority.  20.

Using criminal force or ill-treatment provided for by this section need not necessarily be consequent on or connected with the superior status of the accused. The only essentials necessary to constitute an offence under this section are— (a) that the accused used criminal force to or ill-treated a person subject to AA. subordinate to him in rank or position; and (b) that the accused was acquainted with the identity of the person against Whom he used criminal force or whom he ill-treated. 4.  It is an offence under this section for one NCO to use criminal force or ill-treat another who is not his superior in rank or position. Where two NCOs of equal rank are concerned, evidence must be led to prove that the person against whom criminal force was used was junior to the accused. Where the two are of equal seniority or where one sepoy strikes another, the charge should be laid under AA.s.63 or 69. 5.

(c)  the trial should not take place before a DCM/ SCM.  2.  'Subject to this Act': see AA.s.2.  3.  Clause (a): 'Shamefully abandons', etc.—  (a.)  This offence can only be committed by the person in charge of the garrison, post, etc., and not by the subordinates under his command. The surrender of a place by an officer charged with its defence can only be justified by superior's orders or the utmost necessity, such as want of provisions or water, the absence of hope of relief, and the certainty or extreme probability that no further efforts could prevent the place with its garrison, their arms and ammunition, falling into the hands of the enemy. (b)  It must be proved that the accused had no necessity to surrender or abandon the post before a conviction can be obtained. Particulars of a charge under this clause must detail some circumstances which make abandonment in a military sense shameful. 'Shameful' means a positive and disgraceful dereliction of duty and not merely negligence or misapprehension or error of judgment. (c)  ‘Post’ includes any point or position (whether fortified or not) which a detachment may be ordered to hold; and the abandonment of a post would also include the abandonment of a siege if there were no circumstances to warrant such a measure. It has not the same meaning as in clauses (h) and (k) or AA.s.36(c) or (d), where it has reference to the position of an individual.  4.  Clause (b): 'Intentionally'.— As a state of mind (e.g. intention, knowledge) is not capable of positive proof, the court may infer intention from the circumstances proved in evidence. As a general rule, a person is presumed in law to have intended the natural and probable consequences of his act. A court may also presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of events and human conduct. See IEA.s.114.  5.  Enemy—See AA.s.3(x).  6.  Clause (c): 'Shamefully'.— (a)  The particulars of the charge must show the circumstances which make the act in a military sense shameful; see note 3(b) above. (b) The presence of the enemy must be near at hand and a soldier not in the forward area could not be convicted of an offence if, for example, he casts away his arms during an air raid. (c)  Enemy: see AA.s.3(x). The term includes any person in arms against whom it is the duty of a person subject to military law to act. A person subject to the AA, therefore, who, when a comrade 'runs amok', shows cowardice by refraining from acting against him is liable to trial under this clause. See also Regs Army para 348.  7.  'Misbehaves'.— (a)  This means that the accused, from an unsolder-like regard for his personal safety, in the presence of the enemy, failed in respect of some distinct and feasible duty imposed upon him by a specified order or regulation, or by the well-understood custom of the service, or by the requirements of the case, as applicable to the position in which he was placed at the time. Misbehaviour of any kind not evidencing cowardice cannot be charged under the last sentence of this clause. (b)  Where there is evidence that an accused has committed some other offence which is specifically mentioned in the Act as under clause (a) or (b) or AA.s.38(1) such an offence should be charged in preference to a charge under this clause.  8. Clause (d): 'Treacherously'.— (a)  see note 9(a) and (b) below.  (b)  If there is no evidence of treachery, the charge should be laid under AA.s.35(b). (c) In a charge under this clause, it must be proved that the intelligence did in fact reach the enemy. 9. Clause (f): 'Treacherously' or 'through cowardice'. —(a)  Treacherously implies an intention to assist the enemy and must be carefully distinguished from 'through cowardice'  "", ""135     which occur in this clause. The Intention to help the enemy is an essential ingredient of the offence of treachery and must be proved before a conviction can be sustained. (b)  The particulars of the charge must show the circumstances which indicate the treachery or cowardice, if there is no treachery or cowardice, the charge should be laid under AA.s.35(c). (c)  Enemy: see AA.s.3(x).  10.  Clause (g): Intentionally.—see note 4 above.  11. 'Occasions a false alarm'.— The particulars of the charge must set out briefly the means whereby the alarm was caused.  12.  'Spreads reports',— The particulars of the charge must detail the reports alleged to have been spread, and should indicate how they were calculated to create alarm or despondency. It is not necessary to aver or prove that the reports were false, indeed the truth may increase the offence ; nor is it necessary to show that any effect was actually produced by the reports spread ; it would, however, seldom be expedient to try an officer or soldier under this section for reports which could not be shown to have had some effect. The offence may be committed either with reference to the troops with whom the offender is serving, or with reference to the inhabitants of the country. When the false alarm is occasioned or such reports are spread otherwise than in time of war or during any military operation, the charge should be framed under AA.s.36(e) which makes punishable such spreading of reports etc., even though through neglect.  13.  Camp.— Includes a bivouac and any quarters, shelter or other place where troops are temporarily located.  14.  Clause (h):  Commanding Officer.—see AA.s.3(v).  15.  'Post'.— (a)  When used with respect to an individual as in this clause and clause (k), means the position or place in which it may be the duty of a person subject to the AA to be, especially when under arms. In determining what, in any particular case is a post, the court will use their military knowledge (AA.s.134). The place in which the person was posted is material and should be stated in the charge. (b)  When a person is charged with leaving his post, it is always necessary to prove that he had been regularly posted. (c)  This offence can be committed by any member of the guard, picquet etc., even the guard etc., commander but a joint charge cannot be preferred.  16.  Without being regularly relieved or without leave.-— These words are in the nature of an exception, and the principle laid down in section 105 of IEA applies. Therefore, though the charge must aver the absence of regular relief or leave, this need not be proved, and the fact of the accused person having quitted his guard, etc., being established it will be for him to show that he was regularly relieved or had leave to quit his guard; nevertheless, any evidence bearing on this point which is known to the prosecutor should be adduced.  17.  Clause (i): 'Voluntarily'—  The term as defined in s.39 of the IPC relates to the causation of effects and not to the doing of acts from which those effects result. However, here it has been used more in its ordinary meaning e.g. of his own free will rather than in its technical sense i.e. it means merely that the accused was willing to do the act charged; it is not necessary to show that he volunteered to do it, or even that he wished to do it. In the absence of any evidence that compulsion was applied the court may find that the accused acted voluntarily; but if from the whole of the evidence given the court think that the accused's will may have been overborne by fear they should acquit him. The test is whether the particular accused was in fact so frightened as to have lost control of his will, not whether the methods used by his captors were such as would cause a reasonably brave man to lose control. Coercion will, therefore, be a defence to such a charge.  18.  Clause (j) : 'Knowingly'.— Evidence should, if possible, be given that the accused knew the person harboured or protected to be an enemy who is not a prisoner but if the  "", ""136     fact of the harbouring or protecting is proved, the court may infer knowledge from the circumstances.  19.  'Harbouring'.— The word 'harbour' includes the supplying a person with shelter, food, drink, money, clothes, arms, ammunition or means of conveyance or the assisting of a person by any means, whether of the above kinds or not to evade apprehension : IPC section 52A.  20.  Enemy.— See AA.s.3(x).  21.  Clause (k): 'Post'.— (a)  As used with respect to an individual in this and other clauses the term refers to the position or place in which it may be the duty of a person subject to this Act to be, especially when under arms. With respect, in particular, to a sentry, it applies (i) to the spot where the sentry is left to the observance of his duties by the officer, JCO or NCO posting him, or (ii) to any limits specially pointed out as his beat. The fact that a sentry has not been regularly posted is immaterial if he is charged with an offence committed while on his post provided evidence is given to prove that he adopted the duty of sentry. (b) In determining what, in any particular case, is a post the court will use their military knowledge : AA.s.134. (c)  A sentry found sleeping even a short distance from his 'post' should be charged with leaving his post under clause (h) or AA.s.36(d); he cannot be charged with sleeping on his post under this clause. However, where a sentry is found intoxicated, he could be charged under this clause though he is so found at a short distance away from his post as the place where he is found intoxicated is immaterial not being ingredient of the offence. (d)  A policeman on gate duty is not a sentry. (e)  Two or more accused cannot be tried jointly with committing an offence under this clause.  (f)  The same offence when committed by a sentry in circumstances which do not fall under this clause is triable under clause (c) of AA.s.36.  22.  Clause (l): 'Knowingly'.— See notes 4 and 18 above.  A charge under this clause should particularise the actual acts alleged. The act or acts must be shown to have been deliberately done by the accused with the intention of imperiling the success of the said forces. Such intention may be proved in evidence or may be inferred from the circumstances.""]"

Army_Act_Section_46,"['46.  Certain forms of disgraceful conduct. — Any person subject to this Act who commits any of the following offences, that is to say, — (a)  is guilty of any disgraceful conduct of a cruel, indecent or unnatural kind; or  (b)  malingers, or feigns, or produces disease or infirmity in himself, or intentionally delays his cure or aggravates his disease or infirmity; or (c)  with intent to render himself or any other person unfit for service voluntarily causes hurt to himself or that person; shall, on conviction by court-martial, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.  ', 'NOTES 1 . Offences under this section should not be dealt with summarily under AA.s.80, 83 or 84. 2.  Clause (a). —The particulars of a charge of disgraceful conduct under this clause must specify the details of the act or acts alleged to constitute the disgraceful conduct of the kind charged. In the case of an officer accused, the same facts may constitute an offence either of disgraceful conduct under this clause or of unbecoming conduct under AA.s.45; but see note 3 to AA.s.45.   ', '154     ', ""3.  In the absence of any evidence of a definite act of indecency or attempted indecency, mere words that an indecent or unnatural act was committed are not sufficient to constitute an offence under this clause though a charge may probably lie under AA.s.63. 4.  Disgraceful conduct of an unnatural kind ordinarily implies the commission or at least the attempted commission of an offence under IPC.s.377. Therefore, in framing charges under this clause, the charge should invariably be laid for disgraceful conduct of an indecent kind unless the evidence permits of the averment in the particulars that an unnatural offence as ordinarily understood was committed or at least attempted 5. To allege in a charge under this clause conduct of an indecent and unnatural kind would be bad for duplicity, since they are two separate offences: AR 30. 6.  Cruel.— Cruelty usually involves the doing of some positive act, such as beating or killing or torturing. In most cases therefore the conduct alleged will amount to an offence under some other section of AA. But there are circumstances in which cruelty can be charged against a person who has culpably failed to do what he ought to have done e.g., where a definite duty was imposed upon a person to do something and he failed to perform that duty. 7.  There can be no attempt to commit this offence. See note 1 to AA.s.45. 8.  Clause (b)— To 'malinger' is to pretend illness or infirmity which does not exist, in order to escape duty. To 'feign' disease or infirmity means that the accused person exhibits appearances resembling the genuine symptoms of disease or infirmity which, to his knowledge, are not due to such disease or infirmity, but have been produced artificially or purposes of deceit; e.g., simulating fits or mental disease. To 'produce' disease is willfully to cause genuine disease to develop, e.g., by the infection of microbes or poisonous drugs. The involuntary production, aggravation, or prolongation of delirium tremens by intemperate habits, or of sexually transmitted diseases by immoral conduct, does not render a person liable under this clause; but sec note 7(c) to AA.s.42 as to concealment of sexually transmitted diseases. Similarly a person who refuses to undergo a surgical operation or to be inoculated or vaccinated does not incur any liability under this clause or AA.s.41 as any puncturing or cutting of the skin, mucuous  membrance or tissues amounts to a surgical operation nor can he be punished for refusing to allow anaesthetic to be administered. 9.  'Intentionally'. —In a case under this clause and clause (c), evidence must be given of the intent required therein but it would be sufficient to raise a presumption of that intention if the act in question was shown to have been done willfully and not accidentally 10.  Clause (c). —Intent: see note 9 above. It is usual to prefer an alternative charge under AA.s.63 to a charge under this clause alleging that the accused improperly or negligently rendered himself temporarily unfit for duty. 11.  For the definition of the term 'voluntarily causing hurt': See IPC.ss.319 and 321(Part III). 12.  'Any other person' means any other person subject to AA and not a civilian.  13. Offences of this nature, even when committed in the presence of the enemy should be charged under this clause and not under AA.s.34(c).""]"
Army_Act_Section_40,"['40.  Striking or threatening superior officers. — Any person subject to this Act who commits any of the following offences, that is to say, — (a)  uses criminal force to or assaults his superior officer; or (b)  uses threatening language to such officer; or (c)  uses insubordinate language to such officer; shall on conviction by court-martial, if such officer is at the time in the execution of his office or, If the offence is committed on active service, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to fourteen years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned; and in other cases, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.   Provided that in the case of an offence specified in clause (e), the imprisonment shall not exceed five years.  ', '146    ', 'NOTES 1.  Clause (a).— Offences under this clause should not be dealt with summarily under AA.s.80, 83 or 84. 2.  (a) For definition of \'force\', using criminal force and \'assault\', see IPC.ss.349, 350 and 351 (PartIII).The difference between the offence mentioned in this clause will be clear from the following examples : —  (i)  A throws a stone at B. If the stone hits B, A has used criminal force, if it misses him, A has attempted to use criminal force. (ii)  A, during an altercation with B, picks up a stone in a threatening manner. If A intends, or knows it to be likely, that this will cause B to believe that A is about to throw the stone at him. A commits an assault on B. An \'assault\' is something less than the use of criminal force; the force being cut short before the blow actually falls. It seems to consist in an attempt or offer by a person having present ability, with force to do any hurt or violence to the person of another, and it is committed whenever a well founded apprehension of peril from a force partially or fully put in motion is created, e.g., when a person draws a bayonet or otherwise makes a show of violence against a superior but not when net is behind the bars or at such a distance as to rule out at the moment any actual use of criminal force An assault is thus included in every use of criminal force, and is an intermediate stage thereof. (b)  If the force be used in the exercise of the right of private defence, for instance if it be shown that it was necessary, or that at the moment the accused had reason to believe it was necessary for his actual protection from injury, and that he used no more force than was reasonably necessary for this purpose, he is legally justified in using it and commits no offence. See IPC.ss.96, 97—102 (Part III). (c)  Provocation is not a ground of acquittal, but tends to mitigate the punishment; evidence of provocation, if tendered, must therefore be admitted. Also see note 6 to AR 52. (d) As to intoxication as an excuse or defence to a charge under this section, see note4to AAs.48.   3.  A joint charge under this clause can be sustained provided that the use of criminal force or assault was the result of a concerted action in furtherance of a common intent (IPC.s.34) though in some cases such concerted use of force may amount to an offence under AA. s.37(b) also.  4.  When use of criminal force to a superior is accompanied by insubordinate language, the use of criminal force only should be charged (assuming that the evidence is satisfactory) and the language would be admissible in evidence to show the manner in which the offence was committed.  5.  A person charged with using criminal force may be found guilty of an attempt to use criminal force or assault (AA.s.139(8) and (3)).  6.  (a) Superior Officer.—See AA.s.3(xxiii). (b)  While framing a charge under this section, the name of the superior officer shut be set out in the particulars of the charge. (c)  The expression \'superior officer\' in this section and in AA.s.41 means not only a superior in rank but also a senior in the same grade where that seniority gives power of command according to the usages of the service, but one sepoy can never be the ""Superior officer"" of another. The court should be satisfied, before conviction, that the accused knew the person, with respect to whom the offence was committed, to be a superior officer .If the superior did not wear the insignia of his rank, and was not personally known to the accused, evidence would be necessary to show that the accused was otherwise aware of his being his superior officer, or had reason to believe him, to be this superior officer. If such evidence is not available, the accused should be charged under AA.s.63 or 69. (d)  Where the accused is charged with an offence against a superior officer who is of the same grade, evidence must be adduced to show that the latter is senior to the accused. (e)  The lower the rank of the superior the less is the gravity of the offence. Also see Regs Army para 450.   ', 'NOTES 7. (a) The offence under this clause or clauses (b) and (c) is punishable more severely if such superior officer was at the relevant time in the execution of his office or if the offence is committed on active service. Such aggravating circumstances should not be averred in the particulars unless the case warrants severe punishment and it is intended to try the accused by a GCM. (b)  It is difficult accurately to define the words \'in the execution of his office\', but the military knowledge and experience of the members of a court-martial will enable them in most instances readily to determine whether the superior officer was or was not in the execution of his office. A superior officer in plain clothes may undoubtedly be in the execution of his office; but where the superior officer is in plain clothes, it becomes necessary to prove some knowledge on the part of the accused at the time of the offence that the person who was assaulted or to whom criminal force was used was a superior officer and that he was known to the accused as such, which is not the case where the superior officer is in uniform. On the other hand, there may be circumstances in which a superior officer in uniform is not in the execution of his office. It may be taken in general that using criminal force to or assaulting any superior officer by a person subject to AA over whom it is, at the relevant time, the duty of that superior officer to maintain discipline, would be using criminal force to or assaulting him in the execution of his office.  (c)  When the accused is charged, with using criminal force to or assaulting his superior officer who is at the time in the execution of his office or if the accused is charged with committing the offence on active service and the court is satisfied that the offence was committed but not on active service or that the superior officer was not then in the execution of his office, he may be found guilty under AA.s.139(7) of the same offence as having been committed in circumstances involving a less severe punishment. 8.  Clause (b).—A joint charge of using threatening or insubordinate language to a superior officer should not be preferred. 9.  Where the charge is for using threatening or insubordinate language the particulars of the charge must state the expressions or their substance, and the superior to whom they were addressed. See note 7 above. 10.  Expressions, however offensive to a superior, that are used (a) in the course of a judicial, inquiry, (b) by a party to that inquiry, and (c) upon a matter pertinent to and bonafide for the purposes of that inquiry, as, for instance, the credibility of a witness, are privileged, and cannot be made the subject of a criminal charge. 11 . Expressions used of a superior officer and not within his hearing, or which cannot be proved to be used to a superior officer, must be charged as an offence under AA.s.63, and not under this section, but the use of threatening or otherwise insubordinate language regarding one superior to (in the sense that it is intended to be heard by) another superior constitutes an offence of using threatening or insubordinate language under this section. 12.  Threatening language means language from which a person addressed may reasonably infer that criminal force may be used. This may be inferred either from the character of the words used or from the surrounding circumstances. 13.  Whereas all threatening language is insubordinate the converse is not true; therefore unless there is no doubt as to his intention an accused should be charged with using insubordinate language rather than threatening. A court may, however, if satisfied in other respects that an offence under this section has been committed, make a special finding when an accused is charged with the offence of using threatening language that he was guilty of using insubordinate language. (AA.s.139(4)). 14.  Clause (c).—See notes 7 to 11 and 13 above. 15.  The words must be used with an insubordinate intent, that is to say, they must be, either in themselves, or in the manner or circumstances in which they are spoken, insulting or disrespectful, and in all cases it must reasonably appear that they were intended to be heard by a superior. The words themselves need not necessarily be discourteous. If they indicate a deliberate intention to be insubordinate or resist lawful authority they may properly be regarded as disrespectful of authority, although courteously expressed. Where for instance a sepoy, having been given a lawful command which does not require immediate compliance, indicates respectfully that he does not intend to comply with it and is at once placed in arrest before being given a chance to comply, he may be charged with an offence under this section though not with an offence under AA.s.41(2)     16.  Further a sepoy may in an outburst of temper or excitement use violent language without intending to be in subordinate. Allowance should also be made for the use of coarse expressions by a person of inferior education which might often be used as mere expletives. These expressions might be insubordinate if used by an officer, a JCO or a senior NCO but not so when used by a junior NCO or a sepoy. These points must be considered by a court before convicting an accused of an offence under this clause.  17. As to the use of coarse and abusive language by a person who is intoxicated, see note 6 to AA.s.48. 18.  The words need not necessarily be spoken. If an accused writes a letter containing insubordinate expressions and addresses it to a superior officer, intending the letter to be read by the addressee, a charge would lie under this clause. 19.  The use of what is commonly known as ""bad"" language need not necessarily give rise to a charge either under this section or AA.s.63.']"
Army_Act_Section_36,"['36.  Offences punishable more severely on active service than at other times.— Any person subject to this Act who commits any of the following offences, that is to say,— (a) forces a safeguard, or forces or uses criminal force to a sentry; or (b)  breaks into any house or other place in search of plunder; or (c)  being a sentry sleeps upon his post, or is intoxicated; or (d)  without orders from his superior officer leaves his guard, piquet patrol or post; or (e)  intentionally or through neglect occasions a false alarm in camp, garrison, or quarters or spreads reports calculated to create unnecessary alarm or despondency; or  (f)  makes known the parole, watch ward  or countersign to any person not entitled to receive it; or knowingly gives a parole, watchward or counter sign different from what he received; shall, on conviction by court-martial, if he commits any such offence when on active service, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to fourteen years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned; and  if he commits any such offence when not on active service, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.  ', 'NOTES  ', '1.  Offences under this section when on active service should not be dealt with summarily under AA.ss.80, 83 or 84.  2.  Clause (a): safeguard\'s—A safeguard is a party of soldiers detached for the protection of some person or persons, or of a particular village, house, or other property. A single sentry posted from such party is still part of the safeguard, and it is as criminal to force him by breaking into the house or other property under his special care as to force the whole party. A man posted solely to control traffic is not a ""safeguard"" for the purposes of this provision.   3.  \'Forces\',— Does not necessarily mean use of physical force. Passing the sentry when warned by him not to do so will amount to this offence.       ', '138     ', ""4. 'Uses criminal force'.— For definition of criminal force see IPC.ss.349 and 350. 5. 'Sentry'.- (a) A sentry is posted for protecting some place, property or person and any forcible interference with such protection amounts to an offence under this clause provided the accused was aware that the sentry was in fact acting as such. (b)  An accused charged under this clause for using criminal force to a sentry can be found guilty of attempting to use such criminal force under AA.s.139(8) or of assaulting the sentry under AA.s.139(3). Similarly, if the charge is laid under AA.s.69 for using criminal force to a sentry, the accused can be convicted of attempting to use such criminal force to or assaulting him under A A.s.139(6). (c)  See also note 21 to AA.s.34, as to duties of sentries, (d)  A policeman on gate duty is not a sentry.  6.  Clause (b): (a) The 'other place' should be specified in the charge. (b)  This clause, having regard to special military significance of the term plunder, is applicable only to offences committed on active service. (c)  For definition of 'house-breaking' see IPC.s.445. A house indicates some structure intended for affording some sort of protection to the person dwelling inside it or for the property placed there for custody. What is a house must always be a question of degree and circumstances.  "", ""7.  Clause (c): 'Sentry'.—For definition see note 21 to AA.s.34 and note 5 above. A sentry found asleep even a short distance from his post should be charged with leaving his post under clause (d), he cannot properly be charged with being asleep on his post, though he may be charged under AA.s.63 with being asleep when on sentry duty. However the words 'upon his post' do not qualify the words 'is intoxicated. It is therefore enough to constitute the offence if a person subject to the AA acting as a sentry is found intoxicated on his post or elsewhere during his tenure of duty as a sentry.  8.  Clause (d): Superior officer.—For definition see AA.s.3(xxiii).  9.  'Post'.—(a) See notes 15 and 21 to AA.s.34. When a person is charged with leaving his post it is always necessary to prove that he had been regularly posted or had under taken the duty on that post although he has not been regularly posted. Where a member of a guard or piquet furnishing a sentry for a post receives orders that he will relieve the sentry on the post at a fixed hour, and in due course does so, he will have been regularly posted although the officer, JCO or NCO in charge was not present himself at that time. (b)  This offence can be committed by any member of the guard, piquet Or patrol, even the guard, etc., commander but a joint charge cannot be preferred.  10.

Army_Act_Section_37,"['37.  Mutiny.—-Any person subject to this Act who commits any of the following offences, that is to say,— (a)  begins, incites, causes, or conspires with any other persons to cause any mutiny in the military, naval or air forces of India or any forces co-operating therewith; or (b)  joins in any such mutiny; or (c)  being present at any such mutiny, does not use his utmost endeavours to suppress the same; or   ', '139      (b)  Words in the plural include the singular (s. 13 General Clauses Act, 1897). Therefore a person can be charged under clause (a) with conspiracy with one other person to cause a mutiny. (c)  A person cannot be charged generally with mutiny, or with an act of mutiny, but only with some one or more of the specified offences laid down in this section. If (d)  knowing or having reason to believe in the existence of any such mutiny, or of any intention to mutiny or of any such conspiracy, does not, without delay, give information thereof to his commanding or other superior officer; or (e)  endeavours to seduce any person in the military, naval or air forces of India from his duty or allegiance to the Union; shall, on conviction by court-martial, be liable to suffer death or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.  NOTES 1.  Offences under this section should not be dealt with summarily under AA.s.80, 83 or 84. 2. ( a)  The limitation of time for the commencement of trial (three years) prescribed by AA.s.122 does not apply to the offence of mutiny.  (b)  As the maximum punishment for offences under this section is death ;—  (i)  a summary of evidence must be taken. (ii)  a plea of guilty cannot be accepted [AR 52(4)].  (iii)  the trial should not take place before a summary or district court-martial.  3.  (a)  Mutiny implies collective insubordination, or a combination of two or more persons to resist, or to induce others to resist, lawful military authority. (b) Words in the plural include the singular (s. 13 General Clauses Act, 1897). Therefore a person can be charged under clause (a) with conspiracy with one other person to cause a mutiny. (c) A person cannot be charged generally with mutiny, or with an act of mutiny, but only with some one or more of the specified offences laid down in this section. If he has not brought himself within the terms of the section, his offence, however much it may tend towards mutiny, must be dealt with as insubordination and the provisions of AA.s.40 or 41 will usually afford ample powers for the purpose. Thus, where there is an actual mutiny or a conspiracy to mutiny, all concerned in the mutiny or conspiracy can be tried under this section for causing or conspiring to cause, or joining in, the mutiny, as the case may be. If no mutiny or conspiracy exists, a person can only be tried under this section if the charge is one of being present at a mutiny not using his utmost endeavours to suppress the same or of failing to inform his commanding or other superior officer of an intent to cause mutiny or such conspiracy or of endeavouring to seduce any person in the forces from his duty or allegiance to the Union. (d)  In framing a charge under this section the specific act or acts which are alleged to have constituted the offence must always be averred; and the offence is so grave that a charge for it should only be brought on very clear evidence. Cases of insubordination, even on the part of two or more persons, should unless there appears to be a combined design on their part to resist authority, be charged jointly under AA. s. 40(a) with using criminal force, assaulting, or separately under AA.s.40(b)or(c) with using threatening or insubordinate language, or under AA.s.41, or, if these sections are inapplicable jointly or separately under AA.s.63. Provocation by a superior or the existence of grievances, is no justification for mutiny or insubordination though such circumstances would be given due weight in considering the question of punishment. (e)  Collective petitions/representations or the submission of a petition through the medium of any association in respect of military matters are forbidden on this ground.  4.  If there is evidence that a person caused, or conspired with others to cause a mutiny, but a doubt exists as to whether he took such an active part as to have actually joined, in the mutiny, he may be charged under clause (b) with an alternative charge under clause (a). On the other hand, doubts may arise whether the persons who appear to be taking an active part are actually acting in combination, and in such cases it is desirable to prefer separate charges in the alternative under AA.s.40 or AA.s.41 .as appropriate.   ', '140     ', '5.  Persons present on, parade or present accidentally or induced by false pretences to attend a meeting where a mutiny is being contrived may still be guilty of an offence under clause (c) although they took no active part in the proceedings.  6.  (a)  Not using his utmost endeavour in clause (c) does not necessarily mean the utmost of which a person is capable, but such endeavours as person might reasonably and fairly be expected to make, and every person in a squad not marching or not coming from their barrack room when duly ordered, is guilty of mutiny.  (b)  In clause (d), it will be noticed that the person who comes to know of an existing or intended mutiny will have performed his duty under this clause if he gives information without delay either to his CO or any other superior officer. Such information would naturally be given to the immediate superior of the person, who would, in his turn, be bound to transmit it to higher authority.  (c)  Commanding officer: see AA.s.3(v).  Superior officer: see AA.s.3(xxiii)  7.  Endeavours to seduce etc. the attempt itself is punishable. It is immaterial whether the attempt succeeds or not.']"

Clause (i). — Persons commonly known as \'followers\' are not ordinarily subject to AA unless they have been enrolled under it, but in the interest of discipline and security it is obviously necessary that they and other civilians who accompany any portion of the regular Army should be subject to military discipline on active service and in certain other circumstances. This clause provides for such subjection. All persons, including civilian officers and subordinates, who are subject to AA under this clause are deemed to be of a rank inferior to that of a non-commissioned officer, unless the Central Government have under AA.s.6(1) issued a notification regarding the manner in which such persons shall be so subject: see AA.s.6 and Government of India Notification S.R.O.325 of 1975, (reproduced in part IV) under which civilian government servants are classified as Officers, JCOs. WOs and NCOs according to their total monthly emoluments; the status so conferred is personal and does not give them power of command over others nor does it make them \'superior officers\' within the meaning of the AA.

In all cases reported by court-martial under AR 150, and in many other cases the members are, however, individually disqualified, under AR 39, from sitting at the second trial so that the result is practically the same. A CO cannot, except with the sanction of superior authority, of in a grave emergency, try by SCM an offence under this section committed against his own authority when sitting at another trial. See AA.s.120(2),  (b)  If a person subject to AA is tried for any of the offences specified in this section when committed in respect of a court-martial other than a court-martial held under AA, the charge should be framed under AA.s.63; as such a court is not a court-martial for the purposes of AA;see AA.s.3(vii). 3. See AR.150 and notes for manner of dealing with similar offences when committed by civilians or persons amenable to naval or air force law,  4  As a rule, courts should accept an apology sufficient to vindicate their dignity without resorting to extreme measures. 5.  Clause (a). —' Duly summoned or ordered': see AA.s.135. A person subject to AA. who fails to attend the taking of summary of evidence when ordered to do so can be tried under AA.s.41 or 63 and not under this section, which deals with court-martial. 6.

Clause (b). —(a)  A person who for reasons of sincerity of which the court is satisfied, refuses to take an oath, must be given the opportunity of making an affirmation; see AA.s.131(2) and AR 140. The offence is not complete unless there is proof of a refusal both to take the oath and to make an affirmation provided option so to do is given to the accused. The charges of refusing to take an oath legally required by a court-martial to be taken and refusing to make an affirmation legally required by a court-martial to be made; may, therefore, be properly drawn in the alternative. 8.  Clause (c)— See IEA.s.123-124 which deal with privilege of official documents. Also see IEAs.162. When a witness is directed by summons to produce a document which is in his possession or power, he must bring it to court, notwithstanding any objection that he may have with regard to its production or admissibility. After this has been done it rests solely with the court to hear the objection or the claim as to privilege, and to decide whether it should be allowed. 9.  Clause (d). — Because a person is competent to give evidence, he cannot be compelled to answer every question he may be asked when giving evidence and which is relevant to the matter in issue. For instance, on an incriminating question being put to a witness, he is entitled to ask to be excused from answering it, and if after he has asked to be excused, the court compels him to answer (as they are entitled to do) his answer can not be proved against him at any criminal proceedings except a prosecution for giving false evidence by such answer; see IEA.s.132.

Army_Act_Section_63,"['63.  Violation of good order and discipline. — Any person subject to this Act who is guilty of any act or omission which, though not specified in this Act, is prejudicial to good order and military discipline shall, on conviction by court-martial, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.  NOTES  1.  As a rule a charge should not be preferred under this section where special provision for the offence is made elsewhere in AA. In a proper case, however, an alternative charge may be added under this section. 2.  A charge under this section must recite its actual words, i.e., there must be charged an ""act"" or ""omission"" ""prejudicial to good order and military discipline"". But, of course, an act or omission is not brought within the scope of the section by merely applying to it the statutory language; and a court is not warranted in convicting unless of the opinion that the act, etc., proved was prejudicial both to good order and to military discipline, having regard to its nature and to the circumstances in which it took place. 3. (a) ""An omission"" to be punishable under this section must amount to neglect which is wilful or culpable. If wilful, i.e., deliberate it is clearly blameworthy. If it is not wilful, it may or may not be blameworthy, and the court must consider the whole circumstances of the case and, in particular, the responsibility of the accused. A high degree of care can rightly be demanded of a person who is in charge of a motor vehicle or public money or property, or who is handling firearms or explosives, where a slight degree of negligence may involve loss or danger to life; in such circumstances a small degree of negligence may be blameworthy. On the other hand, neglect which results from mere forgetfulness, error of judgment or inadvertence, in relation to a matter which does not rightly demand a very high degree of care, would not be judged blameworthy so as to justify conviction and punishment. The essential thing for the court to consider is whether in the whole circumstances of the case as they existed at the time of the offence the degree of neglect proved is such as, having regard to their military knowledge of the amount of care which ought to have been exercised, renders the neglect substantially blameworthy and deserving of punishment.  170     (b)  Negligently.—Negligence has been defined by judicial pronouncements as ""the omission to do something which a reasonable man guided upon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do and as ""doing some act which a person of ordinary care and skill would not do under the circumstances""  4. The following are a few instances of offences not uncommonly charged under this section:   Negligent performance of duties connected with money or stores resulting in a deficiency and loss. Being in improper possession of public property or of property belonging to a comrade (where there is no evidence of actual theft) Improperly using Government transport and petrol for private purposes. Borrowing money from persons under his command, gambling, and other cases of disobedience of regulations, which are not published as regimental orders (see note to AA.s.42(e)). Negligently wounding or injuring self or others.  Improperly using or obtaining railway warrants. Sending an anonymous letter to his commanding officer. Neglect of duty when a sentry, on guard, etc.  Causing a disturbance in the lines. Stating a falsehood to a superior officer.  Using criminal force to a comrade,  5.  AA recognises no such offence as ""making a frivolous complaint""; but the repetition of baseless complaints may amount to an offence under this section; so too may a complaint so framed as to be offensive or indicative of insubordination, etc.']"

The term 'lawful custody' in this section means not only military custody as defined in AA.s.3(xiii) but any lawful custody; so that a person subject to AA may be convicted under this section when escaping or attempting to escape from a police officer who has under AA.s.105(2) arrested him as a suspected deserter. Similarly when a person is held by the Provost Marshal or a person legally exercising authority under him or on his behalf under AA.107, he may be charged with an offence under this section. 2.  (a) As military custody includes open arrest, a person escaping or attempting to escape while in open arrest could be charged under this section. (b) A person undergoing field punishment is in lawful custody within the meaning of this section although he is not in arrest. Care therefore must be taken, when framing a charge under this section to ensure that the particulars alleged correspond with the statement of offence. (c) Confinement to the lines is not lawful custody for the purposes of this section. 3.

Remedy of aggrieved persons other than officers. —  (1)  Any person subject to this Act other than an officer who deems himself wronged by any superior or other officer may, if not attached to a troop or company, complain to the officer under whose command or orders he is serving; and may, if attached to a troop or company, complain to the officer commanding the same.  (2)  When the officer complained against is the officer to whom any complaint should, under, sub-section (1), be preferred, the aggrieved person may complain to such officer's next superior officer.

Similarly a JCO or OR who is refused compassionate leave or a compassionate posting has no right of complaint under this section unless he can produce some evidence of improper motive for the refusal of leave, etc.  3.  Complaints may be made respecting such matter, but can be made by an individual only. The combined complaint of several can never be permissible, but should not, if well founded, be treated as mutinous, where it is plain that the only object of those making the complaint is to procure redress of the matter by which they think themselves wronged. 4.  A person can only complain once under this section in respect of any such matter. 5.  A complaint cannot legitimately be preferred to a superior officer except in the regular course defined by this section. The channels through which complaints must be preferred are specified in Regs Army Para 361, and it is only where the immediate superior refuses or unnecessarily delays to redress or forward the complaint that direct application can be made to higher authority. The officer in question ought to be informed of the application being made to his superior. For definition of 'officer' and ‘superior officer' see AA.s.3(xviii) and (xxiii) respectively. 6. The authority competent to dispose finally of the matter, complained of is the officer who, in pursuance of regulations or the custom of the service, is authorized to dispose of that matter.

Only officers should be charged under this clause. 3.  An accused charged under this clause with using criminal force could be found guilty under AA.s.139 of an attempt to use criminal force or assault. 4.  As to intoxication as a defence to a charge see note 4to AA.s.48. 5.

Resistance may also be passive, e.g. a person lying down and refusing to move, if physically able to move, could be said to resist. The particulars of the charge should specify the nature of the resistance. The court will use their military knowledge to determine whether it was the duty of the escort to apprehend the accused or to have him in charge. 7.  Clause (d).—(a) This offence consists of a person quitting barracks, etc., at a time when he had no right to do so, either because he was on duty or under punishment, or because of some regulation or order; and it is immaterial whether the offence was managed by violence, stratagem, disguise, or simply by walking past a sentry unnoticed. The mode in which the act was effected will, however, assist a CO in determining whether a charge be preferred under this clause, or under AA.s. 38(1).

(b) In a charge for breaking out of barracks, it must be proved that the accused left the confines of the barracks, as charged. A charge of breaking out of quarters would hold good in the case of a person quartered in one part of a barrack and improperly leaving that part for another part where he had no right to be. .

Disobedience of a specific order in the nature of a command should be dealt with under AA.s.41 and non-compliance, through forgetfulness or negligence, with an order to do some specific act at a future time under AA.s.63.  (b)  Ignorance of the order is no excuse, if the order is one which the accused ought in the, ordinary course to know. But a misapprehension reasonably arising from want of clarity in the order is a ground for exculpation. The existence of the orders and the fact of the neglect must be proved. The order contravened, (or a certified copy where such copy is admissible under AA.s.142(4) must be produced on oath to the court and the court will make a record in the proceedings of its having been so produced. A written order cannot be proved by oral testimony. Evidence must also be given to show that the order was duly posted or brought to the notice of the accused, or that he was otherwise in a position to be acquainted with its contents. Disobedience of a regulation        "", '151     may be punished under AA.s.63 but if the regulation is published as a regimental order, it acquires the character of a general, local or other order, and disobedience to it may be punished under this clause.

(2)  The certificate from the proper military authority shall state the first and last day of the leave or intended leave, and set forth a description of the case with respect to which the leave was granted or applied for.  (3)  No fee shall be payable to the court in respect of the presentation of any such certificate, or of any application by or on behalf of any such person, for priority for the hearing of his case.  (4)  Where the court is unable to arrange for the hearing and final disposal of the suit or other proceeding within the period of such leave or intended leave as aforesaid, it shall record its reasons for its inability to do so, and shall cause a copy thereof ,to be furnished to such person on his application without any payment whatever by him in respect either of the application for such copy or of the copy itself.  (5)  If in any case a question arises as to the proper military authority qualified to grant such certificate as aforesaid, such question shall at once be referred by the court to an officer having power not less than a brigade or equivalent commander whose decision shall be final.

The Indian Soldiers Litigation Act, 1925 (Act IV of 1925), (reproduced in part IV) provides, among other things, for the postponement, when necessary in the interest of justice, of proceedings pending before a Civil or Revenue Court in India to which any person subject to AA serving under ""special conditions"" (see s.3 of the Indian Soldiers Litigation Act) is a party when such person is unable to appear in person or is not represented by any person duly authorized to appear,, plead or act on his behalf. This concession, however, does not necessarily extend to preemption cases or to cases where the soldier\'s interests are identical with those of any other party to the proceedings and are adequately represented by such other party or are merely of a formal nature.  3. Govt. of India, Ministry of Home Affairs while listing out the service privileges (AA.ss.28-32) have issued instructions to the State Govts to accord priority in respect of Army personnel\'s litigation. See Regs Army para 532 and appendix \'K-1\' to Regs Army.  4. For form of appointment of attorney, see Regs Army para 533.   5. A power of attorney to institute or defend a suit executed by a person subject to the AA is not chargeable with any court fee. See Regs Army para 534.    6.  If the case cannot be disposed of within the period of leave granted, the civil officer concerned may extend leave for such period as will admit of the receipt of a reply to an application to the OC unit for the necessary extension of leave. The civil officer will report to the OC unit any grant of leave sanctioned by him. See Regs Army para 536.']"
Army_Act_Section_25,"['25. Authorized deductions only to be made from pay.— The pay of every person subject to this Act due to him as such under any regulation for the time being in force shall be paid without any deduction other than the deductions authorized by or under this or any other act.  ', 'NOTES  ', '1. The term \'pay\' means the rate of pay with increases, if any, for length of service, to which a person subject to the AA. is entitled by reason of his rank, appointment, trade group or trade classification, and includes additional remuneration such as qualification pay, proficiency pay and the various forms of additional pay. All other emoluments are ""allowances"", which, as the word itself suggests, are purely discretionary and may be withdrawn at any time.  2. It is illegal to make deductions which are not authorized and the unlawful detention of pay is an offence under AA.s.61.  3. \'Due to him as such\', means earned by but not paid to him.  4. Under any regulation for the time being in force: such a regulation need not be a statutory one; (see AA.s.3(xxii). For deductions authorized by or under the Act: see AA.ss.90-91 and AR 205. Instances of deductions authorized by or under any other Act are to be found in the Income Tax Act or the rules made by the Central Government in pursuance of AA.s.4 of the Indian Reserve Forces Act, 1888 under which a reservist who fails to appear for training etc., or takes his discharge between trainings may be deprived of any arrears of pay and allowances due to him.']"
Army_Act_Section_48,"['48.  Intoxication. —  (1) Any person subject to this Act who is found in a state of intoxication, whether on duty or not, shall, on conviction by court-martial, if he is an officer, be liable to be cashiered or to suffer such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned; and, if he is not an officer, be liable, subject to the provisions of sub-section (2), to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.  (2) Where an offence of being intoxicated is committed by a person other than an officer when not on active service or not on duty, the period of imprisonment awarded shall not exceed six months.  NOTES  1.  Intoxication may be induced by opium or any similar drug, as well as by liquor. This section creates only one single offence, viz. intoxication, and in all cases, whether the act was committed on duty or not on duty, the charge should be ""intoxication"". If the offence was committed on duty, or after; the accused had been warned for duty, the fact that the offence was so committed and the nature of the duty should be specified in the particulars of the charge as the character of the offence, from a military point of view, and therefore its proper punishment is materially affected by the circumstance. 2.  Intoxication will be regarded as having the ordinary meaning attached to it in civil life i.e., what an ordinary reasonable person would consider to be such and the fact that an offender is capable or incapable of performing his duty is not a decisive or exclusive test of drunkenness or sobriety. It is, however, one of the tests which should be applied by the court. 3.  A person suspected of being intoxicated cannot be put through any drill or test for the purpose of ascertaining his condition; (Regs Army para 393(b)). As such the best evidence in such a charge is the direct stated evidence of witness(s). 4.  For instructions as to the treatment of a person in arrest for being intoxicated see Regs Army para 393(a). 5.  The offence of intoxication is one which cannot be tried jointly. 6.  Nothing can justify a person subject to AA using criminal force to or assaulting a superior, and great care is therefore enjoined to be taken to avoid bringing intoxicated persons in contact with their superiors. Mere abusive and violent language used by an intoxicated person, as the result of being taken into custody, should not be used as the ground for framing a charge of using threatening or insubordinate language to a superior officer under AA.s.40(b) or (c). If a court-martial is considered necessary, the charge should be framed under this section, the language being treated as in the nature of riotous conduct only, and to that extent aggravating the offence.']"
Army_Act_Section_53,"['53. Extortion and Corruption. —Any person subject to this Act who commits any of the following offences, that is to say, —  (a) commits extortion; or  (b) without proper authority exacts from any person money, provisions or service; shall, on conviction by court-martial, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned. ', ""NOTES 1.  Clause (a). —(a) For definition of extortion see IPC.s.383. (b) Extortion is distinguished from theft in that in the case of extortion, the consent is obtained by putting the person, in possession of property, in fear of injury to him or to any other, whereas in theft the offender's intention is always to take without that person's consent. Further, the properly which is obtained by extortion is not limited, as in theft, to moveable property only. 2.  Clause (b).— Without proper authority: see note3to AA.s.49. 3.

(2)  Any person enrolled under this Act who is dismissed from the service and who, when he is so dismissed, is serving out of India, \'shall be sent to India with all convenient speed,   (3)  When any such person as is mentioned in sub-section (2) is sentenced to dismissal combined with any other punishment, such other punishment, or,in the case of a sentence of imprisonment for life or imprisonment, a portion of such sentence may be inflicted before he is sent to India.  (4)  For the purposes of this section, the word ""discharge"" shall include release, and the word ""dismissal"" shall include removal.  ', 'NOTES  ', ""1.  When an enrolled person's entitlement to be discharged or released accrues when he is out of India, he must, if he so requests, be sent to India for being discharged or released; in other words, the discharge/release must then be carried out in India. An enrolled person can however, be dismissed or removed from the service when serving out of India.  2. Sub-sec. (3) is permissive and must be read with AA. ss.168-169 and 171 which provide for the infliction of sentences of imprisonment passed by courts-martial. The result is that, unless the sentence is one of imprisonment which is to be undergone in military custody or a military prison under AA.s.169 or in regard to which an order for its infliction or partial infliction in local civil custody has been made under AA.s.171 a prisoner cannot legally be kept abroad to undergo his imprisonment, but must be sent to a civil prison in India where it can be inflicted in accordance with this Act. Persons sentenced to imprisonment, which is to be undergone in a civil prison and where no order has been made under AA.s.171 may be kept temporarily in military custody, military prison or other fit place under AA.s.170. .   3.  On active service, however, a sentence of imprisonment may be carried out in such place as the officer commanding, the forces in the field may from time to time appoint : AA.s.169(4).  4.

For deductions authorised by or under AA see AA.ss.90. 91 and AR 205. 3.  AA.s.90(c) also makes provision for penal deductions to be made from the pay and allowances of an officer to make good any sum which has unlawfully been retained or withheld by him but recovery under that clause does not require disciplinary action.

Army_Act_Section_65,"['65.  Attempt. — Any person subject to this Act who attempts to commit any of the offences specified in sections 34 to 64 inclusive and in such attempt does any act towards the commission of the offence shall, on conviction by court-martial, where no express provision is made by this Act for the punishment of such attempt, be liable, if the offence attempted to be committed is punishable with death, to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to fourteen years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned; and ', '172     if the offence attempted to be committed is punishable with imprisonment, to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to one-half of the longest term provided for that offence or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.

Attempts to commit civil offences are not triable under this section but are triable under AA.s.69 read with IPC.s.511. 2.  Does any act towards the commission of the offence: There is a difference between the preparation antecedent to an offence and the actual attempt. To constitute an attempt to commit an offence there must be an intent to commit the offence, a commencement of the commission and an act done towards the commission. An act is said to be done towards the commission of the offence when the offence remains incomplete only because something yet remained to be done, which the person intending to commit the offence is unable to do by reason of circumstances independent of his own volition. These words must not be construed to include all acts, however, remote, which tend towards the commission of the offence. The thing done may be too small or it may proceed too short a way towards the accomplishment of the offence for the law to notice it as an attempt. It must in every case be a question depending upon the circumstances whether a particular act done (with the requisite intention) towards the commission of the offence is sufficiently proximate to its commission to constitute an attempt or is so remote as to merely constitute preparation for its commission. 3. A person charged before a court-martial with any offence under AA may be found guilty of the attempt to commit that offence if the evidence so warrants: AA.s.139 (8).']"
