    "Answer": "An 'assault' is something less than the use of criminal force; the force being cut short before the blow actually falls. It seems to consist in an attempt or offer by a person having present ability, with force to do any hurt or violence to the person of another, and it is committed whenever a well founded apprehension of peril from a force partially or fully put in motion is created, e.g., when a person draws a bayonet or otherwise makes a show of violence against a superior but not when net is behind the bars or at such a distance as to rule out at the moment any actual use of criminal force An assault is thus included in every use of criminal force, and is an intermediate stage thereof"

    "Source of Answer": "assult and criminal force similarity act 40 note 2 a ",
    "Answer": "An 'assault' is something less than the use of criminal force; the force being cut short before the blow actually falls. It seems to consist in an attempt or offer by a person having present ability, with force to do any hurt or violence to the person of another, and it is committed whenever a well founded apprehension of peril from a force partially or fully put in motion is created, e.g., when a person draws a bayonet or otherwise makes a show of violence against a superior but not when net is behind the bars or at such a distance as to rule out at the moment any actual use of criminal force An assault is thus included in every use of criminal force, and is an intermediate stage thereof"

    "Answer": "It is difficult accurately to define the words 'in the execution of his office', but the military knowledge and experience of the members of a court-martial will enable them in most instances readily to determine whether the superior officer was or was not in the execution of his office. A superior officer in plain clothes may undoubtedly be in the execution of his office; but where the superior officer is in plain clothes, it becomes necessary to prove some knowledge on the part of the accused at the time of the offence that the person who was assaulted or to whom criminal force was used was a superior officer and that he was known to the accused as such, which is not the case where the superior officer is in uniform. On the other hand, there may be circumstances in which a superior officer in uniform is not in the execution of his office. It may be taken in general that using criminal force to or assaulting any superior officer by a person subject to AA over whom it is, at the relevant time, the duty of that superior officer to maintain discipline, would be using criminal force to or assaulting him in the execution of his office"

    "Source of Answer": "act 40 note 6 a",
    "Answer": "The definition of Superior Officer is given in Sec 3(xxiii) of Army Act. Further, The expression 'superior officer' in this section and in [**AA.s.41**](AA41.htm) means not only a superior in rank but also a senior in the same grade where that seniority gives power of command according to the usages of the service, but one sepoy can never be the 'Superior officer' of another. The court should be satisfied, before conviction, that the accused knew the person, with respect to whom the offence was committed, to be a superior officer .If the superior did not wear the insignia of his rank, and was not personally known to the accused, evidence would be necessary to show that the accused was otherwise aware of his being his superior officer, or had reason to believe him, to be this superior officer. If such evidence is not available, the accused should be charged under [**AA.s.63**](AA63.htm) or 69.Note 6 (c) of Sec 40."

    "Source of Answer": "act 41 note 3",
    "Answer": "Lawful Command.\u2014The command must be a specific command to an individual i.e., it must be capable of individual execution by the person to whom it is addressed and justified by military, as well as by civil, law and usage, e.g., a command addressed by a superior officer to four persons to 'dismiss' is for the purposes of this section a lawful military command to each of the four persons so addressed. The command must relate to military duty that is to say disobedience to it must tend to impede, delay or prevent a military proceeding. The disobedience must have reference to the time at which the command is to be obeyed. If the command be a lawful command, and demands a prompt and immediate compliance, hesitation or unnecessary delay in obeying it may be sufficient to constitute an offence under this section. A person who on being ordered to do a certain thing at some time, uses words expressing an intention not to obey and is immediately confined, does not commit an offence under this section. He should be charged under not [**AA.s.40(c)**](AA40.htm) or [**AA.s.63**](AA63.htm) according to the circumstances of the case. A neglect to carry out an order due to misapprehension, or forgetfulness, does not constitute an offence under this section though non-compliance with an order through forgetfulness or negligence would be chargeable under [**AA.s.63**](AA63.htm)"

    "Answer": "Disobedience of a lawful order given by a person who is not a superior officer within the meaning of AA.s.3(xxiii) may be punishable under [**AA.s.63**](AA63.htm) if the disobedience was prejudicial to good order and military discipline; for instance, a civilian cannot give a 'lawful command' under this section to a soldier employed under him; but it may well be the soldier's duty as such to do the act indicated, and, if so, he may be punished for not doing it under [**AA.s.63**](AA63.htm). The particulars of the charge should clearly show that the disobedience was prejudicial to good order and military discipline because the soldier had been placed under the orders of the civilian by a superior military authority"

    "Question": "how someone can compare between assault and criminal force?",
    "Answer Score": 22.871307,
    "Source of Answer": "assult and criminal force similarity act 40 note 2 a ",
    "Answer": "An 'assault' is something less than the use of criminal force; the force being cut short before the blow actually falls. It seems to consist in an attempt or offer by a person having present ability, with force to do any hurt or violence to the person of another, and it is committed whenever a well founded apprehension of peril from a force partially or fully put in motion is created, e.g., when a person draws a bayonet or otherwise makes a show of violence against a superior but not when net is behind the bars or at such a distance as to rule out at the moment any actual use of criminal force An assault is thus included in every use of criminal force, and is an intermediate stage thereof"

    "Question": "what realy someone mean when they say in the execution of his office?",
    "Answer Score": 23.78425,
    "Source of Answer": "act 40 note 7 b",
    "Answer": "It is difficult accurately to define the words 'in the execution of his office', but the military knowledge and experience of the members of a court-martial will enable them in most instances readily to determine whether the superior officer was or was not in the execution of his office. A superior officer in plain clothes may undoubtedly be in the execution of his office; but where the superior officer is in plain clothes, it becomes necessary to prove some knowledge on the part of the accused at the time of the offence that the person who was assaulted or to whom criminal force was used was a superior officer and that he was known to the accused as such, which is not the case where the superior officer is in uniform. On the other hand, there may be circumstances in which a superior officer in uniform is not in the execution of his office. It may be taken in general that using criminal force to or assaulting any superior officer by a person subject to AA over whom it is, at the relevant time, the duty of that superior officer to maintain discipline, would be using criminal force to or assaulting him in the execution of his office"
