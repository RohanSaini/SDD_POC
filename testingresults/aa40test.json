A court may, however, if satisfied in other respects that an offence under this section has been committed, make a special finding when an accused is charged with the offence of using threatening language that he was guilty of using insubordinate language. (AA.s.139(4))."},{"Question": "When is insubordinate language an offence?", "Source of Answer": "act 40 note 13", "Answer": "Whereas all threatening language is insubordinate the converse is not true; therefore unless there is no doubt as to his intention an accused should be charged with using insubordinate language rather than threatening. A court may, however, if satisfied in other respects that an offence under this section has been committed, make a special finding when an accused is charged with the offence of using threatening language that he was guilty of using insubordinate language. (AA.s.139(4))."},{"Question": "When can a person be charged for using threatening language or insubordinate language?", "Source of Answer": "act 40 note 15", "Answer": "The words must be used with an insubordinate intent, that is to say, they must be, either in themselves, or in the manner or circumstances in which they are spoken, insulting or disrespectful, and in all cases it must reasonably appear that they were intended to be heard by a superior. The words themselves need not necessarily be discourteous. If they indicate a deliberate intention to be insubordinate or resist lawful authority they may properly be regarded as disrespectful of authority, although courteously expressed. Where for instance a sepoy, having been given a lawful command which does not require immediate compliance, indicates respectfully that he does not intend to comply with it and is at once placed in arrest before being given a chance to comply, he may be charged with an offence under this section though not with an offence under AA.s.41(2)"},{"Question": "Can the charge of insubordinate language be framed without words having been spoken?", "Source of Answer": "act 40 note 18", "Answer": "The words need not necessarily be spoken. If an accused writes a letter containing insubordinate expressions and addresses it to a superior officer, intending the letter to be read by the addressee, a charge would lie under this clause."},
