{'question':different types of investigations,'answer':
(a)	Informal Investigation.   The CO/Formation Cdr may direct one of his subordinate offrs to inquire into a matter and report the outcome verbally to him. <br>
(b)	Semi-Formal Investigation.   This is one man (offr) investigation ordered by the CO/Formation Cdr under AO 4/2000. The offr so detailed will record statements of the relevant witnesses including the suspected accused and submit a written report to the CO/Formation Cdr who ordered the investigation. Semi formal (one man) investigation can be held either in lieu of or in addition to the Informal investigation mentioned above.<br>
(c)    Formal Investigation (C of I).    Formal investigation is done through a Court of Inquiry (C of I) held under ARs 177 to 186. It is legally not mandatory that all cases are investigated by a C of I. If the facts are simple and offence and identity of the offender becomes known through an informal or semi-formal investigation, the disciplinary action may be directed against the accused without going for a C of I. However, investigation by a C of I may be held in addition to the informal (verbal) or semi-formal (one man) investigation.<br>

{'question':criminal force and assault difference,'answer':An 'assault' is something less than the use of criminal force; the force being cut short before the blow actually falls.
