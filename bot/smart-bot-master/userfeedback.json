It seems to consist in an attempt or offer by a person having present ability, with force to do any hurt or violence to the person of another, and it is committed whenever a well founded apprehension of peril from a force partially or fully put in motion is created, e.g., when a person draws a bayonet or otherwise makes a show of violence against a superior but not when net is behind the bars or at such a distance as to rule out at the moment any actual use of criminal force An assault is thus included in every use of criminal force, and is an intermediate stage thereof",
